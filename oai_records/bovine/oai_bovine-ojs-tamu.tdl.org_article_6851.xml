	<dc:title xml:lang="en">An Introduction to the Use of Computers In Bovine Practice</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Davidson, Jeffrey N.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Electronic data processors, computers, have been around since World War II. The first computers were used for decoding of German War codes. From the early l 950's to the l 970's there was a slow evolution of development which had little direct effect on bovine practitioners. The closest the profession came to computers was through Dairy Herd Improvement Centers which utilized large computers to help manage the production records. To this date, DHI Centers have concentrated on utilizing a large mainframe computer and maintaining a central data base. During the I 970's came a wave of new technology that led to the introduction of the microcomputer. This new technology has created an entirely new industry involving the microcomputer and the peripherals and services associated with it.</dc:description>
