	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Approximately three years ago visiting my family doctor's office and noticing a computer there, it occurred to me that if my doctor, practicing by himself in a little rural town, had a computer, I could certainly have one in a five man veterinary practice. Moreover, the machine intrigued me. Thinking about it, I came to the conclusion that it would enable me to get a "handle" on my practice. Actually our practice was out of control and "running itself." For good or for bad, that is what was happening. I thought a computer might be one good way to get control of the costs. This also might save me from getting a management consultant, whom I still may have to hire in any event. I concluded the computer would help me get the command for which I was searching.</dc:description>
