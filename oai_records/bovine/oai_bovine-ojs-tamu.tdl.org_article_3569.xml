	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In late November 2013, a diagnosis of abortion due to Neospora caninum was made in a fetus aborted from a coming second-calf cow in a north-central South Dakota beef herd. The cow was 1 of 81 bred cows purchased at a sale earlier that month. Following the abortion, the purchased group was re-examined for pregnancy and 21/81 cows previously confirmed pregnant were found open. Nine other South Dakota ranchers were identified as having purchased bred cows from the same sale. The sale was held on November 19, 2013 at a north-central South Dakota auction market. All cows originated from a single North Dakota ranch. The heifers were bred to calve in May 2014, and were ultrasounded to confirm pregnancy by a veterinarian on October 17, 2013.</dc:description>
