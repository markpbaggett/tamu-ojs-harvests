	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thank you, Dr. Larson, fellow bovine practitioners and guests. The general theme listed for this morning is "Current Topics That May Change Your Practice." I feel Dr. Larsen was an ideal veterinarian to be in charge of this section. I am sure you read the article which was written by him so ably recently in a veterinary magazine, "Yesterday's Fireman, Today's Practitioner, Tomorrow's Specialist." This is a wonderful trend. Topics he covered in his paper can definitely change your practice. But, why this change?
The dairyman is demanding this transition and economics are probably the big push behind this change. Observations and data that I have are from Wisconsin, possibly somewhat different than Dr. Larsen's or some other veterinarian's in the audience. We still are the number one state in dairying with over 1,000,000 cows; although we are losing numbers of cattle and dairymen. But, with those that are left, we are dealing with an intelligent, well-informed, educated, experienced dairyman. He realizes his problems and his capabilities. He has learned that preventative veterinary medicine is the only way for him to go although he still demands speedy, efficient service in an emergency, at least they do in Wisconsin.</dc:description>
