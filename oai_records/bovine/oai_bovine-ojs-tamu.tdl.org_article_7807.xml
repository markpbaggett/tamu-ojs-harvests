	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I really don't know what I am going to talk about this afternoon. I am supposed to speak about producer-veterinarian relationships. That is one that has been kicked around a long time, as you well know. Some of it is good and some of it bad. We have come from the old "horse doctor" days (anyone without qualifications with the right kind of suave) to where we now have full-fledged, highly-trained people to look after the health of the nation's livestock. I have participated in the survey that the AVMA did, and I was interviewed last spring. I will tell you what I told them relating to this relationship. As you look at the veterinary profession and the need for veterinarians, we in the cattle industry do not see a real shortage of veterinarians. We think there are enough.</dc:description>
