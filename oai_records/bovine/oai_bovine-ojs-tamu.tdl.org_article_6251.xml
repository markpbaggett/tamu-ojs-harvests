	<dc:description xml:lang="en">During 197 4, several of my clients with large dairy calf raising operations suffered exceptionally heavy losses from calf diarrhea. The diarrhea, for the most part, did not pose a problem until the calves were about one week old. Starting usually at the fifth to seventh day of age and continuing until the calves died or recovered 5-10 days later, diarrhea severe enough to require treatment affected close to 90% of the calves. Diarrhea-related mortality at 30 days of age varied from 20-35%. Good sanitation, combined with antibiotic and electrolyte therapy, seemed to have little effect on the course of the disease. The calf management in these herds was considered equivalent to or better than what was working elsewhere within the area.</dc:description>
