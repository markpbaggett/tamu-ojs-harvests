	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I appreciate being given the opportunity to present my ideas and methods of cow-calf herd health practice. I was asked to speak on initiation, maintenance, justification, and records that I use in my practice.
I have to know my clients well to maintain them on a program. They are as different as their problems and needs are different. My clients for various reasons may maintain records, however, for the most part these records usually reflect individual animal performance. They do not reflect herd health or herd performance over a period of years. The client contacts, of course, are usually made on a call basis. For years the caesarean operation was my first contact with many ranchers. Now, controlling the caesarean rate may attract clients to the program.</dc:description>
