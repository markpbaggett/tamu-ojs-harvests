	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mountainview Veterinary Services (MVS) isa nine-doctor, mixed animal veterinary practice. Originating in 2003 as a food animal practice, MVS has grown into a diverse, full-service practice with 3 locations serving the Potomac Highlands of West Virginia and Maryland. The growth and development of MVS is a journey with humble beginnings that will never be forgotten because of the perspective it gives as we practice today. We genuinely strive to serve our clients with whatever means they have, presenting a challenge in the spectrum of care offered. We encourage our doctors and staff to seek areas of emphasis and professional development opportunities to broaden their scope and fulfillment in practice. We want the best for them, and this often involves hard conversations. Vet­erinary practices are like organisms, requiring all systems to work in concert. The leadership continues to encourage a high level of care, communication, and honesty in defining success at MVS. Success in veterinary medicine is often a moving target that’s hard to define and certainly is not for the faint of heart, but with consistent leadership, fierce dedication, and a guid­ing hand from above, veterinary medicine provides a calling second to none. The warm, indescribable, lifelong trust and calling developed through relationships at MVS is the most cherished part of the mixed animal synergy. We hope that our practice encourages others to reach for their goals using a unique collaborative approach. Soli Deo Gloria.</dc:description>
