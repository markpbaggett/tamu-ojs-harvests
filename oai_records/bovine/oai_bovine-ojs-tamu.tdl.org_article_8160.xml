	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Vaccination is an important component for the prevention and control of disease in cattle. However, too often vaccines are viewed as a catch-all solution for management and nutrition errors; the “best” vaccine can never overcome these deficiencies. Proper vaccination in the young and developing heifer is the key to long-term development of that animal as a reproductive unit in the herd. Modified-live vaccines (MLV) have been used because of the good antibody response, longer duration of immunity, fewer doses needed per animal, and lower cost. However, non-adjuvanted MLV vaccines fail to booster well vaccinated animals, as active vaccine-induced immunity neutralizes vaccine virus preventing the MLV from replicating and preventing a booster immune response. Improved adjuvants have increased the scope and duration of both MLV and inactivated virus immunity. The periparturient period (the last 3 weeks prior to calving and the first 3 weeks following calving) are poor times to initiate an immune response—hormonal, dietary and metabolic factors limit immune responsiveness. Postpartum is also a difficult time to vaccinate as lactation energy demands supercedes immunity. Each vaccine program needs to be designed based on animal flow, actual “disease” threats, and labor on the farm.</dc:description>
