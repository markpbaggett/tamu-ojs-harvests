	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Since lameness occurs so commonly and has such significant effects on cattle productivity and farm profitability, manage足ment and prevention of lameness is essential to the design of effective health and husbandry programs. Unfortunately, the causes and distribution of lameness lesions between beef and dairy cattle, as well as the different management groups within a specific production class, can differ dramatically. A recent report analyzing data from 17 dairies found infectious condi足tions, specifically digital dermatitis and foot rot, were the most common cause of lameness in first-lactation cattle. In contrast, non-infectious lesions, namely white line disease and sole and toe ulcers, were the most common cause of lameness in cows in their second or greater lactation. A report evaluating the inci足dence of specific causes of lameness in cattle on 6 commercial beef feedlots found that the most frequently identified causes of lameness were upper limb issues and deep digital sepsis. How足ever, when characterizing different causes of lameness in beef cattle outside of feedlots, there exists a dearth of published data. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the different causes and distribution of lameness in beef and dairy cattle presenting to either a primary care ambulatory service or in house referral services at a veterinary teaching hospital in the southeastern United States.</dc:description>
