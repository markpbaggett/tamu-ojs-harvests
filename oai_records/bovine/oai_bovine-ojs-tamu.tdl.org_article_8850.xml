	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Changing from being a self-employed private practice vet足erinarian to working as a consultant for a large corporation requires self-awareness in what you like, dislike, excel at and require more training for. Audits on different facets of a dairy provide individuals the opportunity to use their brain more than their bodies; however, implementing consulting into a practice model is going to differ based on the clientele, the vet足erinarian and the interests of that veterinarian. Total mixed ration (TMR), parlor, heat, calf and data audits are all ways in which veterinarians can become more involved in a consult足ing role on the dairy and a valued team member. There are advantages and disadvantages to working in industry and an individual must weigh those options to decide what works best for them. In the end, the dairy industry and the veterinary pro足fession are changing, and we must evolve with the needs of the clients and customers we serve if we are going to continue to be a valued member of the team.</dc:description>
