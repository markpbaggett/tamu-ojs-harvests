	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The practice of group, ad libitum feeding of preweaned calves has recently re-emerged in North America as an alternative to individual housing and management. The interest in these systems has largely been driven by the desire to optimize growth rates through the increased intake of milk or milk replacer, and to reduce labor and management requirements. The benefits of increased rates of gain in milk-fed calves have been well documented through a number of key research trials and meta-analyses. In addition to the apparent health benefits to the young calf, the long-term effect on future milk production has been recognized.
As calf feeding programs have evolved, there has often been the challenge of allowing the calf to consume sufficient milk to meet the needs of accelerated growth. Free access to milk or milk replacer has provided the opportunity to maximize intakes and capitalize on some of the potential benefits of early socialization in a group environment. Additionally, acidification of milk or milk replacer has been shown to have some direct benefits in reducing enteric diseases, and has made it easier to alter traditional management systems.
Some new challenges have also arisen with these feeding and management systems. The ability to provide sufficient ventilation, space, and bedding is a key aspect of minimizing the effect of disease in the group-housed environment. This paper reviews the practical application of group feeding of milk-fed calves, with emphasis on application of ad libitum, acidified milk or milk replacer feeding.</dc:description>
