	<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the advent of A.I., the problem of heat detection arose and numerous methods to solve the problem have been developed. These methods vary from frequent observation to the use of steers as heat detectors.
The most prevalent method of heat detection used in our area is observation and when the observer is observant, it is quite successful. However, I am sure most of you have been as frustrated as I have been in some herds where the manager can't or doesn't catch cows in heat. Although I haven't had the opportunity to see a penectomized bull used in a dairy herd, I hope they will work as well there as in the beef herds that have used them.</dc:description>
