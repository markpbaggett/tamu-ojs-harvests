	<dc:description xml:lang="en">As a veterinarian, I am quite selfish in this direction and I fully realized that the sooner I could bring an animal back up to a physiological norm, I would immediately reduce my health problems. So, we started working on this first with additives and gradually using supplement production to accomplish this. We have ended up with a complete ration for this period. I felt perhaps this may be of interest to you. Veterinarians have considered this a nutrition problem, and the nutritionist looks the other way the first few days or weeks, in a feedlot, hoping that the veterinarian will solve the problem! Due to a lack of communication, coordination, or lack of knowledge, nobody has really tackled this problem. We are having some encouraging results. It is a crude field trial where we use scales and disease incidence. Our goal here is to reduce the period of lot adaptation which is the period from purchase weight back to purchase weight. We do not weigh at any specific time. We run some test weights at the end of thirty days and calculate our average feedlot rate of gain. Day of production would be probably the most correct term.</dc:description>
