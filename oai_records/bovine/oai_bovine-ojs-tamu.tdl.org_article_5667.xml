	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Researchers have been busy for many years trying to find the secrets that nature has locked up in the rumen and digestive track of the dairy cow. Their efforts have been to find out just what happens in there and what makes it happen. Many findings have been made and many secrets have been unlocked. However, I am sure that there are many undiscovered things taking place. The objective of this type of research is to find out what the requirements in terms of feed nutrients are for top milk production and proper maintenance of the cow. I feel confident that many of these requirements are known.</dc:description>
