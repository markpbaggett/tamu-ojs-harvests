	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Teat Dips and Dry Cow Infusion Products: Efficacy, Use and Misuse</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Newman, Louis E.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Herd A: A mastitis problem in a large herd using a Clorox teat dip. The teat ends were severely eroded. Discussion revealed that the teat dip was actually a chlorine udder wash diluted to 4% chlorine and the excessive alkalinity was burning the teats. Conclusion: Use only products intended for use as teat dips.
Herd B: A mastitis problem in a large dairy herd which was on a Clorox teat dip and dry cow therapy program. The dairyman stopped dipping and claimed he had fewer mastitis problems. Further discussion revealed that several months before he had begun using glycerin in the dip to improve skin condition. Un-fortunately the resulting chemical reaction produces glyceraldehyde and glucose which support bacterial growth. He was therefore spreading organisms from cow to cow with the "dip." Conclusion: Never add any other chemicals to a chlorine teat dip.
Herd C: A mastitis problem in a small dairy herd using a0.5% iodine teat dip and dry cow therapy. This was one of many unfortunate dairymen who used a .5% iodine solution in a 99.5% petroleum base which was designed to be a good skin conditioner. Studies have shown that the product is ineffective and in fact may increase infection. Conclusion: Use one of the products which have been thoroughly field tested.
Herd D: A mastitis problem in a small dairy herd using a1 % iodine teat dip. A bacteriological survey showed that the problem was due to Streptococcus agalactiae. An analysis of the situation revealed that he was using a teat sprayer. He was not getting enough teat end coverage to get adequate disinfection. Other experience has shown that it is very difficult to doÂ· an effective job with a sprayer. Conclusion: Do not recommend teat sprayers until a good one is designed and properly field tested.
Herd E: A mastitis problem in a large dairy herd using a chlorhexidine (Nolvasan) teat dip. In this herd the complaint was that they were not making very rapid progress in reducing mastitis. Chlorhexidine was used n several U.S. studies and has been shown to be nearly as effective as iodine and chlorine if used in the proper concentration. The solution should contain 1 % (10,000 ppm) of chlorhexidine. Using it at this concentration makes it the most expensive teat dip on the market. The high cost encourages dairymen to overdilute the solution, greatly reducing its efficacy. Conclusion: Teat dips must be used in the recommended concentrations.
Herd F: A mastitis problem in a large herd using a 1 % iodine teat dip solution and dry cow therapy. A bacteriological survey of the herd revealed a Pseudomonas problem. A check of the spray system used to wash udders and rinse inflations yielded Pseudomonas. Source: The quaternary ammonium compound used in the water. Others have indicated similar findings. Conclusion: Amoid quaternary com-pounds in udder disinfection.</dc:description>
