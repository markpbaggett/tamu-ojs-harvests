	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this article is to report on the evaluation of cow-side ketosis-tests used with milk to detect subclinical ketosis. Our findings indicate that Pink Milk® and Ketolac® BHB are highly sensitive and specific tests for subclinical ketosis when used with milk. Other tests such as Ketocheck™, Utrecht, Bioketone, Ketostix®, Rapignost®, Uriscan™, Ketur®, Medi, and Azetonreagenz were poorly sensitive but highly specific for subclinical ketosis. Hence, Pink Milk® and Ketolac® BHB may be useful to monitor cows for subclinical ketosis on a regular basis.
Cows with subclinical ketosis produced one to four liters milk less daily (Dohoo and Martin 1984, Duffield 1997). The interval from calving to first service was longer, they needed more services to conceive (Wenninger and Distl 1994), and they were at increased risk of developing cystic ovaries (Gustafsson and Emanuelson 1996), clinical ketosis and displaced abomasum (Duffield 1997, Geishauser et al. 1998b). About 90% of the subclinical ketosis cases were diagnosed within the first two months after calving, and the prevalence of ketosis peaked in the second or third week after calving. Between 10% and 30% of fresh cows already had subclinical ketosis in the first week after calving (Dohoo and Martin 1984, Duffield 1997, Francos et al. 1997). However, losses due to subclinical ketosis can be minimized by early detection and treatment of cows affected (Girschewski et al. 1977).</dc:description>
