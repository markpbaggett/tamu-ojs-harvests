	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This presentation outlines how three large dairy farms with common ownership implemented programs to make standardized animal care and treatment decisions. The approach used on these dairies may offer concepts useful to others seeking to enhance their involvements and outcomes in these areas. Central to the effort on these dairies was identifying the one specific owner, partner or manager who would make the final policy decisions as well as the veterinarian(s) authorized to negotiate final drug and treatment policy and protocols with the owner. These dairies established an Animal Care and Health Policy Group to lead this effort. This group comprised of the owner, veterinarian, and Dairy Herd Managers meets at least monthly to discuss, establish and modify animal care and treatment policy, protocols and procedures. The policy group often includes or consults with others such as veterinarians representing pharmaceutical companies, drug vendors and milk inspectors in both policy planning and staff training activities. Monthly meetings are scheduled at each dairy to train animal care managers and their associated staff. Veterinarians involved in these planning and training activities have developed a portfolio of technical services and communication and language skills that they can provide more expertly and more conveniently than others.</dc:description>
