	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The use of growth promoting implants has been a tool widely utilized by the beef cattle industry for many years. The first available implants came to market in the 1950s. Today, usage of implants is widespread in the confined cattle feeding industry. Comparatively speaking, less adoption of the technology has been applied in both the cow-calf and stocker phases. Research shows production benefits in all phases of the beef industry. Concerns have been raised regarding whether implants should be used for growth promotion in the beef industry. With these concerns in mind, safety and the impacts of quality on beef show little if any negative consequences to the use of implants on beef available for consumption.
Recent adjustments to implant labeling have created some chal足lenges and confusion in how we are able to utilize the technol足ogy. As veterinarians, it is important to understand label re足quirements in each phase of the beef industry. Additionally, it is important to understand how implants are placed in the ear to assist producers in obtaining the best return on their invest足ments when they decide to utilize this technology.</dc:description>
