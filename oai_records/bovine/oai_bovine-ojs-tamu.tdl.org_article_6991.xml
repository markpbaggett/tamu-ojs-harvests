	<dc:description xml:lang="en">It may seem a little unusual to you to listen to a nonveterinarian speak at a bovine conference, but if anything, it is a little intimidating for me. I can't help but wonder if you aren't sitting there wondering what a "city girl" marketing director like me could possibly have to say that might interest you. I know if our roles were reversed, and I was sitting where you are, I'd have a few things to wonder about!
First of all, I want to reassure you that it is not just me. I'm just the lucky person the AABP invited out to talk to you about food animal marketing. What I share with you is the consensus of economic and veterinary experts throughout the country and the findings of AVMA's US Market For Food Animal Veterinarian Medical Society' study. I also bring to you over 16 years experience in marketing, much of which was spent in healthcare marketing.
I am Director of Marketing at AVMA. I have been with AVMA for almost two years and in that time I have developed and presented two different marketing clinics for them: one for food animal practitioners and one for companion animal practitioners. The talk you are about to hear today is actually an except from the food animal marketing program; but before I get into that, I'd like to address some of the common misunderstandings and misconceptions many veterinarians hold about marketing.</dc:description>
