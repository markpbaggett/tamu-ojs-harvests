	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fasciola hepatica, the common liver fluke, has been known to cause ill health in livestock for over 100 years in the United States, yet it remains a parasite of importance in the Gulf Coast and Pacific Northwest. One of its major effects is to cause ane­mia, however, its presence may not immediately be considered, especially in the southeastern United States, because of the highly pathogenic and ubiquitous barber pole worm, Haemon­chus contortus. Little research has been conducted on F. hepatica in the United States in recent years, and goats appear to have been much less studied than sheep and cattle. Alternative, complementary diagnostics to conventional fecal examination (normally using sedimentation techniques) would be useful, as would new anthelmintics. However, in the absence of both, control of liver flukes must be given careful consideration in terms of maintaining animal health and welfare and preserv­ing the efficacy of existing flukicides. Testing for efficacy of anthelmintics currently used in practice would contribute to­wards making recommendations regarding their rational use.</dc:description>
