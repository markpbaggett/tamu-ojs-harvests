	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In New York State, coveralls have long been the attire of choice for bovine practitioners. However, after only a few years in practice I had become disenchanted with cloth coveralls. They were too hot and heavy in the summer. My wife tired of constantly sewing rips and tears. Worst of all, laundry was a constant chore because both the coveralls and the clothes under them were dirty on a daily basis. After months of searching for a better alternative to coveralls, I was introduced to KOOL DRI RAINWEAR while visiting some veterinarians in Wisconsin. They weigh only 12 ounces yet are durable enough to survive veterinary work. While they block the wind in the winter they remain cool and breathable in the summer. Best of all, they are waterproof so manure, urine, blood, and uterine fluids do not soak through.</dc:description>
