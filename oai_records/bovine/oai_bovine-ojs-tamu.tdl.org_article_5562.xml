	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The weak link in the chain of achievement of maximum efficiency in an artificial insemination (Al) program, particularly in the western beef industry, has been failure of observation of the female in heat. Twice a day visual observation of eligible cows and heifers has long been the tried and true method of heat detection for the stockman. However, many other methods have been used to aid the competent observer in his detection work. One of the most successful practices used in our particular area has been the employment of the "detector" bull with a chin-ball marking apparatus attached.
We have long discounted using detector bulls which have the ability to copulate because of the risk of disease spread by these animals. Various methods of copulation prevention have been used such as the penectomy (1), surgical adhesion of the penis to the abdominal wall (2), or bibs on the intact bull (2). One of the simplest methods is the penile retraction and fixation technique. Dr. Tracy Rhoades of Buffalo, Wyoming, (3) first explained to this writer the surgical procedure he had used in a practice in Nebraska. The authors decided to attempt the technique about a year and a half ago and have experienced a moderate amount of success.</dc:description>
