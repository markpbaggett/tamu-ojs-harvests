	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Thoughts on Preconditioning</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Reddick, Harry</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">For a practice tip this year I want to convey some ideas, rather than describe a specific treatment or procedure.
For many years we have heard a great deal concerning pre-conditioning. I would like to discuss my ideas concerning pre-conditioning as it pertains to feedlot cattle. Any time we talk about pre-conditioning we must also include words such as reputation, misrepresentation, and salvage. In theory, pre-conditioning is excellent; in practice it doesn't work so well. Perhaps the name should be changed to reputation. Pre-conditioning implies something extra. The name "reputation" implies nothing more than good management practices. Cattle with a reputation for doing a good job in a feedlot need no certificate to guarantee their worth the next time around. Cattle with a good reputation will command the top dollar each year. During times of feeder cattle shortages this is not too important, but on a buyers' market all of the good management practices will still be well compensated.</dc:description>
