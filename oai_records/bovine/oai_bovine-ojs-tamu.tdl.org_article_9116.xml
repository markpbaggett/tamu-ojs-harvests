	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Current trends and new developments in assessing and managing pain in cattle</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Pain management in cattle presents unique challenges due to regulatory considerations, cost and difficulty assessing pain in these animals. This presentation summarizes key findings from recent research on pain management practices in the beef and dairy industry, focusing on the use of analgesics, challeng­es in drug approval, and the communication and perspectives between producers and veterinarians. The research highlights the increased use of pain management in older cattle, with veterinarians showing greater odds of utilizing analgesia com­pared to producers. Painful routine procedures, such as castra­tion and dehorning, are identified as common sources of pain for cattle, emphasizing the need for effective pain mitigation strategies. However, the limited availability of FDA-approved drugs for pain management in cattle poses significant chal­lenges for industry stakeholders, both financially and practi­cally. Furthermore, this presentation explores communication and perspectives regarding pain management between produc­ers and veterinarians, aiming to understand the impact of dis­agreements on their relationship and their perceptions of rec­ognizing pain in cattle. The findings underscore the necessity for more FDA-approved pain management drugs for use in cat­tle to address the challenges the beef and dairy industry faces.</dc:description>
