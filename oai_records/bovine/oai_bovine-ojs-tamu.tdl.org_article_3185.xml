	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A startup rural practice requires time, dedication, resilience, and determination. The confounding factors of practicing lay people and unscrupulous drug and distribu_ tor reps makes starting a veterinary business all the more challenging. Have a clear picture of what you want from your practice and what the area needs. It is necessary to consider the practitioner's strengths and weaknesses and how these correspond to the needs of the area. New owners should strive to keep a low overhead and grow incrementally as their client base increases. Determine what the largest income sources will be and tap into those at the beginning. Follow this with what the area next needs ( education, facilities, advanced services) as your practice grows. Having tenacity and resilience will assist the new owner in maintaining a steady composure throughout the first years. Owners should set themselves up with a network of advisors from throughout the veterinary and local community to contact with business and professional questions.</dc:description>
