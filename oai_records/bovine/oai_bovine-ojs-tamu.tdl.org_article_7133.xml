	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of a number of useful indicators to assess on-farm welfare of sheep and goats in commercial systems. Assessing the welfare of production animals is vital to ensure that optimal conditions are provided by animal managers. Welfare is a multifactorial concept that is difficult to describe as there are multiple definitions and interpretations. However, welfare is generally concerned with an animalâ€™s quality of life and includes natural living, affective state, and biological functioning. Animal welfare assessment protocols for sheep and goats use a variety of animal-, management- and resource-based indicators of welfare. Management- and resource-based indicators are useful for on-farm welfare assessments, as they can be reliably and quickly measured; however, animal-based indicators may give a more accurate indication of specific welfare conditions, as they directly focus on the animal. Useful indicators should be valid, reliable, and feasible, and some examples include body condition scoring, hair/fleece condition, skin lesions, claw overgrowth, lameness, and the human-animal relationship. Identification of areas of welfare compromise is the first step in order to improve the welfare of sheep and goats on-farm.</dc:description>
