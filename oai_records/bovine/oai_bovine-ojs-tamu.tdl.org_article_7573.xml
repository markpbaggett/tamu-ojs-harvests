	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two titles were considered for this paper, "Engineered Management in Housing" and "Free Stalls and Cattle Health / Comfort." Being somewhat self-conscious about talking to veterinarians about health, the author chose the first title. Light (1973) defined engineered management as " ... the process of physical design of individual elements of any housing system to have them function in accord with management decisions." He further indicated that the decisions made during the design of a housing system affects how the system will function. The designer, through the ultimate design, imposes upon the operation of the unit a set of management routines which will have to be followed for the life of the unit; management has been "engineered" into the system ( or out of it). In simple terms, this paper will discuss observations as to the affect of barn design and construction on the health and well-being of animals and your ability to keep them healthy.</dc:description>
