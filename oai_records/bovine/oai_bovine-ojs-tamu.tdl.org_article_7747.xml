	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The American Association of Bovine Practitioners. What a title! You are the guys that were the high percentage in your class. The guys that beat me out so I had to go farming. I want to express my appreciation to you. You know, I could see you guys working hard to get your marks in school, college, so you could get up into that 3% so you could get into veterinary school. You got into veterinary schools and you broke your backsides to get through veterinary school. You mortgaged everything you had to start a practice. When you got out there, what did you find? Biting horses, kicking cows, scratching cats, retained placentas that were two weeks old, hoof rot and so forth.</dc:description>
