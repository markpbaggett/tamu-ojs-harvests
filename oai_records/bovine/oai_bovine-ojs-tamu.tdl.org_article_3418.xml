	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Veterinary practices and all organizations are experiencing challenges in attracting and retaining employees. At the same time research increasingly reveals that most employee management practices are wrong. Most simply stated, we have tried to manage employees when, in fact, people - employees - are fully capable of managing themselves.
A revised definition of business success is required to truly recognize the role of people in organizations. The fundamentals of business remain crucial; however, to optimize success, all businesses must also be healthy. A healthy organization has high productivity, low turnover, high morale and job satisfaction, minimal confusion, and minimal politics (often referred to as "drama").
Research on human behavior and brain function sheds great light on employee motivation and a healthy business. Employees are productive, engaged, and passionate when their psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence are fulfilled. Autonomy is our human need to have choices. Relatedness is our need to care about and be cared about. Competence is our need to feel effective at meeting everyday challenges and opportunities.
Five skills to increase autonomy, relatedness and competence are active listening, vision, clarity, quality feedback, and continuing growth. Providing these increases the motivation, productivity, and retention of staff.</dc:description>
