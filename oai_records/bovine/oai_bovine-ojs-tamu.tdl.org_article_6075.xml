	<dc:description xml:lang="en">District VII includes the states of Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas. Recently, an animal technician questionnaire was sent to all members of the AABP. I received 27 from my District. Thirteen veterinarians used technicians in their practice. Fourteen did not use animal technicians in their practice. Of the 13 veterinarians who did use animal technicians, three employed technicians with formal training and ten trained their own technicians. Of the fourteen who did not use technicians, only two were opposed to the concept and most of the other twelve stated it was a good concept or they would use technicians if practice would warrant it.</dc:description>
