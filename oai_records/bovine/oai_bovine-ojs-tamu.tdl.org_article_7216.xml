	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Bovine Respiratory Disease is a multifactorial syndrome, which negatively impacts performance and welfare among cattle on feed. BRD is associated with viral and bacterial pathogens; but other causal factors include management techniques and environmental stresses. Immune systems of many species, including bovids, have the capability to become compromised by stress. Low-stress cattle handling (LSCH) and acclimation methods are thought to lower stress and may potentially benefit the health and performance of feedlot cattle. Low stress handling methods use the natural behavior and innate responses of cattle to minimize negative consequences due to handler interactions. Acclimation methods familiarize cattle with their environment and, therefore, decrease stress. It was hypothesized that cattle that were acclimated and handled with LSCH techniques would vocalize less and display calmer behavior in a squeeze chute compared to cattle that had not been acclimated and had been handled conventionally.</dc:description>
