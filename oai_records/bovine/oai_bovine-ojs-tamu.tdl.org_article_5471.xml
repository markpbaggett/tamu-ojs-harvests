	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I am speaking for most of us in saying we are happy to be here. The very fact that you have typical northern Wisconsin weather and about three-quarters of our speakers for this morning's session are unable to get here including your Secretary of Agriculture, however, leaves something to be desired for the selection of a site for a winter meeting! To that end, some us are going to push Atlanta in 1975! Truthfully, we are very pleased with the turnout which I believe is a record - not only do we have a fine showing of dairy practitioners which are most close to my heart, but also a good Texas representation as we found out yesterday with regard to the beef people. So far as the program this morning, it has been suggested, and I think well warranted, that we spend a little extra time in the coffee and milk break program that's listed on your program to being at 10:00.</dc:description>
