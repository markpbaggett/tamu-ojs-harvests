	<dc:description xml:lang="en">We spent one whole introductory session, just looking at the cover of the puzzle box. In doing so, we attempted to draw attention to the need for balance in the immune response, in dealing with bovine respiratory stress factors, and in prevention of clinical bovine respiratory disease (BRD). We barely peaked inside the box, but did examine several puzzle pieces of general significance which we identified as some of these stresses. One of the big ones was people (us). As an example of one of the smaller, individual pieces of the BRD puzzle, we gave passing attention to Pasteurella haemolytica.
We attempted to show that health was balance, and that imbalance resulted in disease. Infection was almost incidental. And finally, the main point of that introductory discussion was an attempt to argue that imbalance upward, overreaction or hypersensitivity could be as harmful as imbalance downward, which we can call immunosuppression.
As we now draw a few more individual pieces from the puzzle box, let us also make an attempt to demonstrate how these other pieces, the common respiratory virus infections, relate back to that bigger puzzle picture.
If they are of significance as opportunistic pathogens, they create imbalance. Traditionally, we have restricted our thinking almost exclusively to downward, and have been guilty of concentrating only on immunosuppression. But today, let's go onward, and upward!</dc:description>
