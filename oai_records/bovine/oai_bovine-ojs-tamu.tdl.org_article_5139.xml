	<dc:description xml:lang="en">First of all, why should we be concerned about internal parasites in cattle. Figures released by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1965 compared the losses over a ten-year period. Losses jumped in cattle from about 27 million dollars to about 147 million. Almost the opposite occurred in other species, and to me it indicates that up to 1965 we had not been too concerned with internal parasites in cattle. We did do a pretty good job of controlling them in all the other species.
These things are hard to see. The largest are about one to one and a quarter inches long. They are roughly about the size of a hair on your eyebrow. They lay eggs at a very rapid rate. They can lay up to 10,000 eggs a day, or seven eggs a minute and 1 am sure that if you had some chickens that would perform that well, you would soon have the egg market cornered!</dc:description>
