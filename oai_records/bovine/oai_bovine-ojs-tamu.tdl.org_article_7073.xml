	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The question everyone always wants to know is how to get paid for what you do. As I have traveled around from practice to practice, I have seen a great deal of different ways to charge for your services. It is hard to say which is right and which is wrong but it is important to choose a method that best fits your style of practice.
The important question that must be asked by every veterinarian is how much of my time am I really getting paid for? When one actually takes the time to figure out his real chargeable hours per day, the results can be disappointing. Most veterinarians make around $50 per hour for their program work. If the average veterinarian spends 60 hours of week working and works 50 weeks a year, the average income for their service time only should be $150,000 per year plus drugs and supplies. Unfortunately, many veterinarians income for services fall far short of this. Take the time a figure your real hourly rate rather than the rate you actually charge. Are you disappointed?</dc:description>
