	<dc:description xml:lang="en">More calves are lost annually from scours than from all other calf diseases combined. The known etiologic agents are many and have been extensively described. Whatever the etiology of scours, the dehydration resulting from the disease probably stands out as the single major cause of death.
Administration of fluids is not only the professional approach to the problem of calf scours but also the most rewarding to clients. Although most large animal practitioners are aware of the need for fluid therapy, they often feel that the approach is impractical because of the time required to administer the necessary volume.
This paper deals with the practical aspects of fluid therapy to combat dehydration in baby calves. The technic to be described has been used successfully in our practice. Of over 1000 calves(representing 180 herds) treated by this method through the past three calving seasons, over 70%were able to return and be put back on the cows.</dc:description>
