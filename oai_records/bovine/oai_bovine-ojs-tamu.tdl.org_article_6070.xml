	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This has been a real interesting discussion. I don't think that I could become involved in anything that requires as much discussion as it is apolitical issue not only in the veterinary profession, but also for the general public. I had 53 answers to the questionnaire that was mailed. Out of these, 24 said they were using animal technicians and 29 said they were not. On the question, "Would you use them in the future?," 22 said no, and six said they were thinking about it. I'm hoping these answers give a pretty good representation of the population in District III. The answers came back all the way from Florida. There were probably more comments from my district than any other region about why they would not consider using animal technicians.</dc:description>
