	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Practice ownership has long been an expectation in large ani­mal medicine. However, with student debt loads, increasingly high ownership is something that new graduates are giving serious thought to prior to moving forward toward ownership. As animal agriculture continues to grow and evolve, young vet­erinarians need to consider their own ambitions in ownership, personal goals in both veterinary medicine and business, as well as if the practice they are looking to purchase aligns with these ambitions. Careful evaluation of a business’s culture, atmosphere and leadership can aid in making the decision if ownership is the right path for you. While the financial consid­erations are substantial and important, taking the time to have the right conversations regarding the future of the business and partner goals is just as important in creating a successful part­nership and long-term practice ownership.</dc:description>
