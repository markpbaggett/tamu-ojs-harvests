	<dc:title xml:lang="en">An Approach to Herd Health Programming for the Smaller Cattle Feedlot Operation</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Hentschl, Arnold F.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the livestock production methods changing to larger more complex and costly units, the veterinarian is assuming more of a role in disease prevention and control in cattle feeding enterprises by becoming a staff member or consultant for these units. His services are available on aperiodic and regular basis, and he renders continual consultative advice. The following outline is a general approach for such veterinary services to the smaller-sized feedlot operation, which in effect would put the veterinarian on the feedlot's management staff and his services and advice would be available on a year-round basis. I am deeply indebted to Dr. John Herrick for his advice, counsel and technical assistance when we first embarked on this type of program. Many of these items were initially espoused by him.</dc:description>
