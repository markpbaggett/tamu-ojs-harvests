	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The cattle grub is a pest that has been with us for many years, but is one that has often been neglected. With the coming to our industry of the cattle feeding era, we saw much more interest in the cattle grub problem. Prior to the 50's, no materials were available except a product that would kill the cattle grub when it was in the back. Rotenone was used but only killed those larvae that had already cut an air hole in the back. In the mid 50's, systemics were discovered which did effectively control cattle grubs. Since that time, many products have come forth that will effectively control cattle grubs.</dc:description>
