	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Accurate recordings of vacuum levels and vacuum fluctuations during milking provide the best means of demonstrating the adequacy of any milking system. However, anyone involved in on-farm testing of milking equipment realizes the challenge in picking the "right cow" to check during milk time evaluations. Simply having a stranger in the parlor or the barn with test equipment will often upset the normal milk letdown and interfere with the flow rate on some cows identified as fast milking individuals. The JennyLynn Flow Simulator was developed to allow testing to be done in a controlled situation where the flow rate is known and repeatable.
The artificial teat installed on the Jenny Lynn Flow Simulator has been fabricated to meet the ISO/DIS standards for artificial teats. These standards were certified by an ISO/DIS committee in a paper dated May 14, 1994. The test teat has a six (6) millimeter tube opening through the teat and extends 7 mm past the end of the teat with an additional thirty (30) millimeter extension of flexible hose which collapses during the closed phase of normal liner movement.</dc:description>
