	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ketosis has been a recognized problem in dairy cattle since the late 1920's when the role of glucose and energy demands were first associated with this condition.1 Descriptions of a disease syndrome, now thought to be ketosis, characterized by anorexia, decreased milk production, and constipation appeared in veterinary texts 50 years prior to this.2,3 A more complex type of ketosis was recognized by Sollman4 and Alston5 which, unlike simple ketosis, was associated with high mortality and a variety of concurrent disease problems. Morrow6 called this disease "Fat Cow Syndrome" based on the physical condition of affected cattle. Like simple ketosis, the disease occurred at or around parturtion. The typical histologic lesion common to these affected cows was severe fatty infiltration of the liver (hepatic lipidosis).
This same finding (hepatic lipidosis) is not only found in overly conditioned cattle but also in poorly conditioned animals during the periparturient period. As with the Fat Cow Syndrome cows, these cattle also suffer from a variety of concurrent diseases.</dc:description>
