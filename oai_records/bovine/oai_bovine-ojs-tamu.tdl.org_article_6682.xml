	<dc:description xml:lang="en">It is indeed a pleasure for me to be here this morning -- and to have the opportunity to address you at this Plenary Session.
Even though I've spent a good part of my life traveling and working in over sixty countries of the world -- I haven't had many opportunities to be in such close association with people of your profession.
When I was growing up on a depression era farm in North Dakota, we usually didn't call the vet until our cow or horse was almost dead -- and so there was usually little reason for him to spend much time on our farm -- except to administer the last rites.
I remember after he left, my father and I would quickly skin the dead animal and sell the hide so we could pay his nominal fee.
In more recent years, it seems, the only times I've talked to veterinarians has usually been with dogs barking in the background and my own undisciplined dog straining at his leash.
So I quickly accepted when I was asked to address you, for I knew this would be a more favorable environment -- or at least I hoped it would be!
Today, I've been asked to look into my crystal ball and tell you what I see ahead for the livestock industry.</dc:description>
