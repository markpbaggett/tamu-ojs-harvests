	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Information on reasonable antimicrobial regimen design, particularly for extra-label use, is not currently available in a single easily-accessible source. Sources of information are scattered and may be difficult for the practitioner to locate in a timely manner. Even if the data are located, the interpretation may not be evident to the practitioner, particularly interpretation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.
The need for a system designed for the food animal veterinary practitioner is also apparent as the discussion in the public health venue focuses on the appearance of antimicrobial-resistant human pathogens. The correlation between antimicrobial use in food animals and the appearance of resistant pathogens in the human population may not be unequivocally established. However, there is little doubt that antimicrobial use, whether in human or veterinary patients, may affect microbial populations by selecting for resistant organisms. Therefore, a need exists for the prudent use of antimicrobials such that efficacy is maximized while selection for resistant pathogens is minimized. Prudent use also contributes to longevity of the clinical utility of antimicrobials we currently have. These statements are made realizing that we know a lot more about maximizing efficacy than minimizing resistance development.
With these needs in mind, the AABP, along with the Academy of Veterinary Consultants (the first to financially support the effort), the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American Association of Swine Practitioners, and the American Veterinary Medical Association have contributed a total of $189,000 as startup money over a 3 year period. Supporting funds started to arrive in March of 1999.</dc:description>
