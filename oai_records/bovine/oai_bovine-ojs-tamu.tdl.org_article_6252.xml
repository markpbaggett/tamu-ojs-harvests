	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Thank you and members of the AABP. It's nice to be able to come to Atlanta and spend some time with you. It is a real honor to come down here. I don't know when I have enjoyed an evening as much as I did last evening. I just hope we can put on as good a show for you in California next year. We would like to try and present here today how maybe structure and some of the defense mechanisms interrelate and may result in production of disease; and then how the bovine lung responds to disease. These may explain possibly why we have such a problem with the resolution of some of the respiratory problems in the bovine lung. I will quickly review some of the anatomy of the lung and see if we can't relate some of it to the disease mechanisms.</dc:description>
