	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Advantages of Clinic Versus Ambulatory Practice</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Bieri, Russell O.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">On this past Thursday afternoon the temperature outside was a minus 15 degree~ and there was a northwest wind of 12 to 15 miles per hour. The radio was announcing that the wind chill factor was approximately minus 40 degrees! This is definitely the time to really enjoy the benefits of an "in clinic" practice. This particular afternoon was spent in the confines of the clinic doing surgery which would have been impossible to perform in the pole barns or the feedlots. Yes, one of the great advantages of a clinic practice is being able to perform our services in a nice warm area rather than in the bitter cold of the lots and barns.</dc:description>
