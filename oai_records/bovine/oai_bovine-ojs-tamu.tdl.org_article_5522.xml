	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Developments in the Beef Cattle Industry During the 1970's</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Laster, D. B.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Most of us will discuss freely, on an informal basis, the general direction in which we believe the beef cattle industry is likely to be going during the next decade - but we are hesitant to formally present and publish our thoughts on this topic. The reason is that the variables that will effect change are so numerous and complex and we are not sufficiently satisfied with our understanding to present our thinking so that it can be evaluated, criticized and tested against what actually happens. Many presentations, such as this one, direct most of the attention to the past with little toward the future and the economic and technological developments that may determine the future. Past events and cycles do provide an indication of what we may expect in the future, but I believe the Â·number of mistakes recycled in the future will be fewer than the mistakes that we have recycled in the past. In other words, we can expect managers of beef cattle production, marketing, processing and merchandising units to have a higher batting average with their decisions. The need for bold and imaginative thinking in planning to provide for the required services of a dynamic beef cattle industry will continue to increase and will be mandatory for those of us who plan to occupy a professional support role in the beef cattle industry of the future. The time is now for all interests identified with the beef cattle industry to realistically assess the present status of the industry and to determine, to the extent feasible, the nature of the beef cattle industry of the future. Such an evaluation or projection is probably more critical for the beef cattle industry than for the other meat animal industries because of the long generation interval for cattle and the relatively high investment per production unit.</dc:description>
