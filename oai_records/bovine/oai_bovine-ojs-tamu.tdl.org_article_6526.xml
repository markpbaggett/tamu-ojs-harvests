	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Historically, regional and national veterinary associations have served a much needed role in the continuing education of the profession. This was done using focused one-topic seminars, as well as presentations covering a wide range of general topics. At species specialty group meetings, such as the American Association of Bovine Practitioners (AABP), pre-convention workshops from one to three days in length have been used to cover a broad range of important dairy health management topics. These seminars have provided the desired depth and intensity of subject coverage. However, with such meetings held only once per year, it has been difficult for an individual practitioner to develop the continuity of educational exposure necessary to build a complete slate of seminars (7). These continuing education programs have not offered a planned approach for the progression of courses. In addition, there is no accepted way to assess competency, nor respond to the on-going individual needs of the practitioners enroled. It would be difficult to document a significant change in overall dairy health management programs implemented by the majority of participating practitioners.</dc:description>
