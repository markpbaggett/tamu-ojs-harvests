	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Anti-inflammatories are highly recommended as a method to reduce pain and inflammation associated with certain diseases, injuries, stressful events, and painful procedures in beef cattle. Unfortunately, glucocorticosteroids have been associated with adverse health effects when used as ancillary therapy for diseases such as bovine respiratory disease. As such, the use of less potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as meloxicam, have gained popularity in recent years. Although effective at mitigating pain, meloxicam has impacts on health that are not fully understood. The first objective of this research was to determine the effects of meloxicam administered upon arrival at the feedlot on primary vaccination response. This was achieved by measuring BHV-1, BRSV, BPIV-3, and coronavirus (CV) titers i) during vaccination upon arrival at the feedlot to determine baseline titers, ii) after 7 d to detect acute immune response, and iii) after 21 d to detect peak immune response. The second objective was to determine the impact of meloxicam on health outcomes by evaluating morbidity and mortality through 45 d.</dc:description>
