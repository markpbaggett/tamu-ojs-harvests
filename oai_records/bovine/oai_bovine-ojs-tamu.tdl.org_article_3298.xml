	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Finding the right first job is a good feeling. However, even though it might be the right first job, it may not be the forever job. The most important thing is to be true to yourself and listen to your "gut". Do you truly know what you want, do you want to be an owner? Do you want to be in a group practice or solo? Do you want to be in THIS practice? Once you can answer these questions, it is important to know that being an owner takes time. There are risks, benefits, rewards and responsibilities. My philosophy on ownership is that as an owner I may work more, not less, because it is MY business, MY clients, MY reputation, and MY profit on the line. Being an owner doesnâ€™t mean you can take off whenever you want and leave the rest to the associates and staff. Being an owner means you may work weekends on building maintenance, office work or covering for a shortage. The clinic's success is dependent on you and those who work for you. Ownership is not necessarily a smooth, easy or straight road. There are bumps, frustrations, risks and rewards along the way and there are hundreds of different ways to get there. The income, responsibilities, equity and even challenges have allowed me to become a better person, manager and veterinarian for my clients. I'm better able to help my clients with their businesses and be a stronger leader for them, my employees and even AABP. Ownership seems to be a road less traveled, but it has certainly made all the difference in my life.</dc:description>
