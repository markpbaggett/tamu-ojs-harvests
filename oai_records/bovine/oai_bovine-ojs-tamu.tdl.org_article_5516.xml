	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I am from Idaho and I know that some of you know where it is. We refer to it as God's country but this last week I think God went to Miami. I work for one company and it is a big outfit scattered between western Nevada and, mostly, in southern Idaho. It goes into the northern end of Utah and it has feedlots, cow-calf dairy range, sheep, dogs and working horses. Our total on-feed cattle in three feedyards amounts to about 75,000 to 90,000, depending on the season. We have 10,000 mother cows and they are on about seven ranches. We have just started in the dairy business, so I am learning a lot! We are milking 310 now and have about 100 replacement heifers. We are going out of the sheep business because this does not pay any more and we have about 15,000 range ewes left. We run about 200 working horese (by that I mean horses we ride and use to move our cattle). I usually do not know from one day to the next what I will be doing for a living.</dc:description>
