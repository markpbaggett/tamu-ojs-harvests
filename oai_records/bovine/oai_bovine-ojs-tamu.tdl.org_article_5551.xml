	<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have had some interesting conversations about the role of the veterinarian as a consultant. Basically, I'd say it is a matter of performance. That is the key as far as we are concerned. In the time we have been in business, I suppose we have made every mistake that you could make. And we've tried to correct them as best we can. In doing this, we have called on our veterinarian to give us information that is not available to us through other sources. What makes his service so valuable is the performance we get out of it.</dc:description>
