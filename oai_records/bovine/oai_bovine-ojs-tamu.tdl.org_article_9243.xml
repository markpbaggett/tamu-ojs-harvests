	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Animal health and performance research trials are commonly performed to evaluate ways to improve production efficiency and well-being. The objective of these proceedings is to provide information on how to search for research articles, evaluate articles and what to do when no research is available. Open-source databases, such as Google Scholar, PubMed and AGRI足COLA, are available to search for articles. Research articles are generally divided up into sections: abstract, introduction, mate足rials and methods, results, discussion and conclusion. The null hypothesis is typically there is no difference between treatment groups. After evaluating the study, we need to consider the pro足duction system where the study was performed and study the population for potential external validity. Unfortunately, there will not be data to support every decision made in veterinary medicine. When no information is available, you can try to sort through other study types, work in different species, and/or in vi足tro to make the most informed decision possible. Identifying and evaluating scientific studies can take some time to sort through all the information; however, it is an important process to make sure appropriate application is performed in the field.</dc:description>
