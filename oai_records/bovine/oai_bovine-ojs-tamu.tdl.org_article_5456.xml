	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In food-producing animal health management and production, antimicrobials are used for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, and to enhance growth promotion. These uses of antimicrobials represents one of several important health management strategies which contribute to animal health and well-being and to the economical production of wholesome meat and milk products. The control of animal disease also means control of certain infectious diseases which may be transmitted to humans. However, there are some potential human health hazards associated with antimicrobials used in food animals. Residues of drugs may occur in meat and milk and could enter the human food chain and increase the risk of ill-health in persons who consume products from treated animals. Of greater current importance is the potential for the emergence of antimicrobial resistant enteric bacteria which could be transferred to humans resulting in clinical disease which may be difficult to treat.
This paper will review the evidence that the use of antimicrobials in beef cattle health management and production in North America allows the emergence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria, which may be transferred to humans and subsequently cause disease which is difficult to treat because of antimicrobial resistance. Some of the scientific publications and other documents which have examined the various aspects of antimicrobial resistance over the last 30 years will be summarized and their conclusions examined. Some historical aspects are included in an attempt to better the understand the problem. Some references to the use and effects of antimicrobials in health and production management in swine and poultry will be made for comparative purposes.</dc:description>
