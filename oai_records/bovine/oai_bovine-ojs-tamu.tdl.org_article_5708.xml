	<dc:description xml:lang="en">One of the main problems in the feeding industry today is the shortage of 600 to 800 lb. feeder cattle. The solution seemed simple-buy next year's feeders as calves. The advantages of calf feeding were less dollars invested and cheaper cost of gains due to improved feed conversion. With calves coming off the ranches from all parts of the nation, death losses became alarming. It soon became apparent that a 4% mortality was an average acceptable death loss. The inclement weather and other factors, some pneumonia outbreaks reached mortality rates as high as 15 to40%. The yards looked to the veterinary profession to help solve these problems. The discussion of this paper will be limited to the handling of calves from the ranch into the feedlots.</dc:description>
