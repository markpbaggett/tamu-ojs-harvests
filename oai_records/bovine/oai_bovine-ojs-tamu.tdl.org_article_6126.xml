	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Although ova transfer in the cow was first successfully accomplished in the early 1950's, it took 20 years before it was used for commercial purposes on a practical basis. The early stimulus for the development of ova transfer in cattle was its value for research. Considerable information has been gained concerning reproductive physiology in other species in which ova transfer has been successful for many years; e.g. in the rabbit and swine. This research value may be genetically oriented as well as physiologically oriented. Presently cattle progeny testing is directed mostly at testing the transmitting ability of the male since insufficient offspring numbers limit such testing of the cow. With superovulation and ova transfer, selection based on the female transmitting ability may also be established.</dc:description>
