	<dc:description xml:lang="en">"Becoming Indispensable" is the question that is posed to you as a veterinarian. For most this would be finding a niche that would make them profitable or that niche unique thinking outside of the box. To me "Becoming Indispensable" is so much more. It is becoming a public mentor for my community as a steward of veterinary medicine. It is creating a family type work environment that is approachable by anyone and everyone contributes to knowledge provided. It is starting with nothing and working hard to create that system overall. My main goal is to provide a story type depiction of how you can start with something, a run down and outdated veterinary practice, and make it a highly successful rapidly growing integral part of the community we serve all a while maintaining a work life balance with a successful family. "Becoming Indispensable" it is a lifestyle not a service provided to a client.</dc:description>
