	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Even after a severe drought and a few very challenging years, there is still close to 30 million beef cows in the United States. It is estimated that less than 5% of producers are utilizing an AI program in their herds. Accordingly, there are about 4.1 million replacement heifers in the US with around 15% utilizing AI. The percentage of heifers being bred using AI is on the rise, and will continue to rise as we begin to rebuild the nation’s beef herd. With only 3 to 5% of herds utilizing AI across the United States, there is tremendous room for growth of these services.
We’ve seen the price of bulls go up exponentially over the past few years. The price of an AI program hasn’t changed that much. Semen prices and synchronization drugs have increased by less than 5%. It’s a lot easier to talk to producers about an AI program now than it has ever been in the past. I believe the veterinarian is the person best suited to offer the most complete services. From genetics consultation to synchronization programs to arm service to all the associated services, artificial insemination has the potential to be a profit driver for any bovine-associated veterinary practice.</dc:description>
