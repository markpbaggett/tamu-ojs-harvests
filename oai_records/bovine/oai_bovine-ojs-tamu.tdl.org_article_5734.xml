	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Potential Uses of Prostaglandins (PGF2a) for the Practitioner and Cattle Industry</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Morrow, David A.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Prostaglandins are potent biological compounds which affect many physiological mechanisms. They comprise a family of 20-carbon fatty acids which occur naturally in many body tissues. Prostaglandins, unlike circulating hormones, are thought to produce their biological activity by a direct local action, primarily by altering smooth muscle contractility and manipulating hormonal activity. Prostaglandins are rapidly metabolized by passage into areas of the body such as the lungs.
The compound which currectly is of greatest interest to reproductive physiologists is Prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a). This compound has the ability to cause rapid regression of the corpusluteum. Many researchers believe that prostaglandins are the uterine luteolytic factor produced near the end of the estrous cycle, which are responsible for rapidly terminating the functional life of the corpus luteum and controlling the onset of estrus and ovulation.
The objective of this paper is to review recent reproductive research dealing with PGF2a in cattle and to outline potential uses for the veterinarian and cattle industry, pending approval for commercial use by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA). PGF2a 1s currently available for use non-lactating cows on a controlled experimental basis in order to establish data on dosage, safety and efficacy.</dc:description>
