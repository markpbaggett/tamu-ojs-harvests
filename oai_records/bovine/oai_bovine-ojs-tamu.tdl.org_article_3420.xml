	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In 1996, the Animal Drug Availability Act created a new category of products called veterinary feed directive (VFD) drugs. These are livestock antibacterial drugs (medically important) intended for use in or on animal feed. Any animal feed containing a VFD drug to be used in animals will be required to have a veterinarian issue an order, called a veterinary feed directive (VFD), providing for such use. The purpose of this rule is to limit the use of medically important antibiotics in livestock to those considered necessary for assuring animal health, and only for treatment, control and prevention of disease. The VFD is an authorization granted by a licensed veterinarian who is familiar with the client's operation and provides health, management, and treatment recommendations. This type of professional relationship is known as a veterinary-client-patient/producer relationship (VCPR). Medicated feed articles have a number of approved claims and uses; however, the use of VFD drugs does not permit any extra-label drug use.
Whenever antibiotics are used, resistance by susceptible bacterial populations is likely to occur. However, our stewardship responsibility is to use all of these products in a judicious manner and to demonstrate a greater awareness and accountability in this arena.</dc:description>
