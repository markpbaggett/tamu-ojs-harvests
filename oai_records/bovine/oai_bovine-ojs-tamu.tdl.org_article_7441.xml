	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Motivating yourself and your client to improve their operation is something that I try and work with on a daily basis
The thing that I think is important is that we need to think of the client's needs first, not ours, but what is our client's need and our client's want to be successful. The dairymen's needs have changed treatment to production medicine and the question that I have is: Do we fit those needs? I guess I've had trouble thinking that we've done a poor job fitting those needs and we'd have to change. Listen to what the dairymen want and then we must provide it. Let's not provide what we want, but let's provide what those dairymen need. Let's listen to his needs and figure out what he has and what he wants to be successful.</dc:description>
