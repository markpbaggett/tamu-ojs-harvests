	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ninety-six stocker calves were purchased from several sale barns in central Arkansas and delivered as a group to the University of Arkansas Beef Cattle Research Facility in Savoy. Processing was done within 24 hours and serum was collected for baseline determination of a-glycoprotein and haptoglobin. The calves were blocked by weight and randomly assigned to 1 of 16, 1.1- acre grass lots, with 6 calves per lot.
Calves pulled for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) from group 1 were treated with flunixin meglumine1 at 2.2 mg/kg body weight, IV and tilmicosin4 at 10 mg/kg, SC when first pulled. Calves from group 2 were treated with tilmicosin at 10 mg/kg, SC without non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) therapy. Blood was collected each time an animal was treated for BRD, as well as 48 hours after treatment. Serum was used to determine aglycoprotein and haptoglobin levels using agar gel immunodiffusion5 (AGID).</dc:description>
