	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The bovine respiratory (BRD) complex resembles a gigantic and frustratingly difficult puzzle. Those of us who wrestle with potential solutions to this complex problem often become preoccupied with its individual pieces. Possibly this is because we have yet to visualize how all these pieces fit together. Possibly this is because there is no picture on the cover of the box.
Veterinary scientists from all disciplines have contributed significantly to our joint understanding of many of the individual pieces of BRD, however, in recent years, the most exciting new findings are being reported from the field of immunology. While many other scientists have studied bits and pieces, immunologists are now beginning to suggest ways that these parts may interact and fit together.</dc:description>
