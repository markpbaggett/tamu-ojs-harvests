	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Future vet: Current trends in demand for veterinary services on dairy farms</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Warvrin, William J.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The industry that is served by the dairy veterinarian is dy­namic and operates under conditions where the value of its end products decrease in real dollar value over time. This exerts pressure on that industry toward constant improvements in operating efficiencies and cost reductions. It is no surprise then that as part of the service sector to this industry, the practicing dairy veterinarian will need to be as dynamic and constantly striving to improve and increase the value of its offerings to this ever-evolving sector. The veterinary work force is highly select­ed and highly trained. It has been an integral part of advance­ment in the production of dairy foods. With a forward-looking attitude striving for constant discovery of new and useful ideas for advancing cow health and productivity, it will be possible to assure that this remains true. Conversely, lacking this outlook, there is the real risk that the veterinarian becomes less relevant on dairy farms over time as those farms compete on a global level for market share.</dc:description>
