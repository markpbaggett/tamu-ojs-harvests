	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The point where a down cow is no longer considered to be down temporarily but has become a "real" downer is at best arbitrary. Therefore, the line between prevention and treatment is also arbitrary. This terminology matter is only an academic issue, but it is useful to point out a general principle. That is: many of the measures used to prevent downers are the same ones used to manage downers in order to prevent them from getting worse and thereby provide time for healing. The major management tools1 for both prevention and treatment are:1. Providing a good non-slip surface to make it possible for cows to stand unassisted whenever possible.2. Providing a means to minimize compression damage due to recumbency. The 2 main tools here are comfortable and clean bedding and a variety of lifting or support methods.
Prevention and treatment of the primary causes of recumbency per se are beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in detail by other participants. Much can be done to prevent metabolic problems by good dry cow dietary management, but the more mundane matter of providing a safe environment for calving is often overlooked.</dc:description>
