	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The title that they gave me on this program is “Welcome to Western Cattle Country,” and I think that is an appropriate title for here, in Denver. This is the crossroads of the cattle industry in many ways. Those of you who took tours yesterday, I am sure, realize how versatile this is as you went to Greeley, Fort Collins, and Louisville, where you saw lots of different types of country. You saw that it was a large cattle-feeding area, and you saw some cattle-raising. Of course, you saw very little of the cattle-ranching part of this state or these western states. You did see one of the fine dairy herds. This is one of the second or third fastest growing states in the nation, and we do have ever-increasing dairy herds.</dc:description>
