	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The total number of beef cows in North America has significantly declined because of lack of profitability, drought, and increasing carcass weights.
Moreover, there has been considerable consolidation of the beef industry at all levels, from the cow-calf producer to the retailer. The number of cattle producers has declined and the size of operations has increased (Figures 1, 2, and 3). The beef business has transformed from "mom and pop" operations into large-scale, sophisticated enterprises that are profit-motivated and are achieving economies of scale by spreading fixed costs over a large number of units. As a result, there are less total patients (Figures 4 and 5) and customers for beef cattle veterinarians. Carcass weights have increased in the face of declining cattle numbers (Figures 6 and 7), thereby maintaining tonnage of beef supply to meet consumer demand. In addition, the opportunity to see these patients has been further reduced as beef producers have assumed the role of performing many of the task-oriented activities that have traditionally been reserved for veterinarians, such as primary care and pregnancy diagnosis.</dc:description>
