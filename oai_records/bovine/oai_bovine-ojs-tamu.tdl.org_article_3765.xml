	<dc:description xml:lang="en">For many dairy goat producers, a key deciding factor for keeping does in the herd is the animalâ€™s ability to maintain milk production. Subclinical intramammary infections (IMIs) are known to decrease milk production in does by as much as 20% (Contreras et al, Livest Prod Sci, 2003). Somatic cell count (SCC) is a reliable and inexpensive predictor of infection in dairy cows; however, this measure is highly variable in goats depending on factors such milk production, stage of lactation, and estrus activity (Leitner et al, J Dairy Sci, 2004; Paape et al, Small Rumin Res, 2007; Persson et al, Small Rumin Res, 2014), making identification of infected glands by SCC level problematic. Thus, it is likely that producers underestimate infection prevalence on their farms. While IMIs are possible throughout lactation, the highest risk period for infection is when does are transitioning from one lactation to the next. On many farms, goats are dried-off (i.e., milking is ceased) and during the dry period infections may go unchecked and new infections begin. In other situations, does are not dried-off between lactations. The aims of this study were 2-fold: 1) to assess the attitudes of the producers regarding IMIs on their farms, and 2) to determine the prevalence of these infections during the dry period.</dc:description>
