	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Despite the fact that bacterial infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the large animal neonate, the early diagnosis remains a challenge for both the veterinarian and the calf manager. In some situations, a focal/localized site of infection can be identified. This leads the clinician to suspect a bacterial component in the problem of his/her patient and to recommend the appropriate therapy. However, septicemia/bacteremia can occur without a detectable primary site of infection. It is also possible that the septicemia/bacteremia state actually precedes the localization of infection. In such case, early antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. Experienced calf feeders develop good clinical judgment and often initiate early treatment in sick bovine neonates. If a record keeping system exists on the premises, it is easier to follow and to continue appropriate therapy. Because of the continuing increase in public concern about antimicrobial use, we believe that the veterinarian should provide guidelines to help his client appropriately target calves for antibiotic treatment.
Several questions remain that have no single answer. (1) What are the most informative clinical signs on which to base an adequate antimicrobial therapy? (2) How long should the therapy be continued? (3) How many animals really benefit from antimicrobial therapy? (4) How many animals suffering from a bacterial infection are not treated adequately? (5) Which is the best antibiotic to use in calves?
The purpose of this presentation is to share our experience studying septicemia and to target the future goals of research in this field.</dc:description>
