	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Metabolic profiling as originally defined using the Compton Metabolic Profile procedure was insufficient for identifying herd problems. More recent research has better characterized metabolic dynamics around the time of calving and their relationship with high prevalence of metabolic and infectious disease problems. This, coupled with a series of factors including improved diagnostic tests, increasing herd size and recognition of transition cow health impact on herd performance, have revived interest in new testing protocols to assess herd periparturient disease risk. Cost and interpretation have been the limiting factors to widespread adoption of a metabolic profiling procedure. New strategies to reduce costs and yet maintain some useful diagnostic value have evolved either herd-based diagnostic or screening approaches. Use of pooled samples collected from pre-defined physiologic groups, and testing a wide array of analytes, have been advocated as a practical and economical method of screening the dairy herd for periparturient disease risk. Key diagnostic analytes identified as predictive for transition cow problems include non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), NEFA:cholesterol ratio; B-hydroxybutyrate, albumin, calcium, sodium and magnesium. The current challenge is development of diagnostically valid interpretation criteria for pooled samples. Most importantly, it must be remembered that metabolic profiles are almost useless without being coupled with animal and facility evaluations, body condition scoring and ration evaluation. The combination, used within a team approach, can be an extremely useful diagnostic tool in nutritional evaluations of the dairy herd.</dc:description>
