	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The immune system is the focus of intense current research in both veterinary and human medicine. This research encompasses such diverse areas as cancer treatments and AIDS vaccines. Many of the advances in future treatments of diseases are already coming from chemicals derived from the immune system. With increased pressure on drug residues, these products will continue to flourish.
There are some important concepts to consider when making these decisions. These concepts often change as we look at the different organisms that can attack the cow. Different diseases are handled differently by the immune system. The life cycle of the organism will also determine what parts of the immune system are important for protection.
What does immunity really mean? For all practical purposes, if a cow is healthy and is exposed to a disease agent, the animal rids the organism with minimal disruption of body functions. The immune system often moderates disease rather than preventing infection.</dc:description>
