	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Probably the reason I am here is because I am one veterinarian that is very interested in herd health practice, not necessarily just in feedlot but in cow calf production as well, and I am possibly one in the state that they could get a hold of that has had some experience with computers and so part of the reason I am on the program. I do not have anything in the way of lot of detailed programs or anything like that to offer you this afternoon for cow calf operations. What I would like to try to do in just a brief few&amp;nbsp;mmutes is possibly outline for you or at least give you some thought on to how you could possibly utilize a computer, be it by terminal as Gary talked about or possibly having one of your own or working with a rancher that has his own.&amp;nbsp;</dc:description>
