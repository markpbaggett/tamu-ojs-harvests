	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The use of robotic milking systems is growing rapidly in North America. Most installs have been on smaller farms that desire an improved lifestyle and to minimize the need to hire labor. The majority of robotic milkers are single box systems where one robot arm services one milking box, but some newer designs are multi-box where one robotic arm will service two to five milking boxes.
The two types of cow traffic in robotic milking systems are guided flow and guided flow. In free flow cow have free access to feed, the lying area and the milking robot. Guided flow systems have pre-selection gates that help guide cows that need milking to the robot.
There are several keys to making robotic systems successful. One major factor is that successful producers really like working with cows. Robotic milking systems require excellent management for success. Other major factors that drive success include feeding management and well-designed facilities that facilitates excellent cow flow and efficient labor management. It is important that producers develop realistic cash flows. Taking a whole system approach in design and management will maximize the RMS performance.</dc:description>
