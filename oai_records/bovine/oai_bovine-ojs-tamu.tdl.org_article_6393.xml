	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Several computer diagnostic programs have recently been developed for use in both human and veterinary medicine. Computer diagnostic programs are particularly useful for the diagnosis of uncommon diseases and "atypical" outbreaks of common diseases. The primary purpose of these programs is to generate a set of likely differential diagnoses based on information collected about the case. The input information is usually restricted to clinical history and clinical signs. A list of possible diagnoses is generated, generally with no indication of which of the possibilities are most likely. We have developed a computer aided bovine diagnostics program which is unique in many respects. The emphasis is on the diagnosis of herd problems as opposed to the diagnosis of isolated diseases affecting a single animal. Thus, gross and histologic necropsy findings are included as input fields, along with clinical history and clinical signs. Multiple observations are entered into the program to obtain a list of differential disease diagnoses. The program graphically displays 1) the probability of disease occurrence in the users locale (hazard rating), 2) the probability that an input observation will be seen with each disease listed, and 3) the severity of lesions/signs observed with each disease listed. With this information the user is able to determine which of the diseases listed in the differential diagnosis are most likely in the given situation. The program is versatile in that the user can change the hazard ratings for diseases, add new diseases, and put in additional signs/lesions for any given disease in the program. The program is designed for use by clinicians and laboratory diagnosticians.</dc:description>
