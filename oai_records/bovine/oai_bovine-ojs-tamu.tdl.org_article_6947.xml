	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Death of cattle in the feedlot has caused the loss of countless dollars of potential profits annually by cattle feeders. Managers spend large amounts of their time and energy in an effort to decrease these losses in order to save this revenue for the feedyard and their customers. When viewed from an economic standpoint, a feedyard which will annually feed 60,000 head might have an average death loss from various causes of approximately one percent or about 600 head. If these cattle are fed on the average from 725 to 1100 lbs. their median weight would be equal to 912.5 lbs. for a total annual loss of 547,500 lbs. At an average selling price of $72.00 per hundredweight, this would equal a loss in equity of $394,200.00 This is in terms of average value of the cattle. Associated reduction in revenue would be the loss of the potential value of finished beef, loss of interest and veterinary expense, loss of potential feed sales and finally the decrease in profit potential by the cattle owner.
Obviously the causes of death in feedlot cattle are numerous and difficult to predict. Realistically, every feedyard has or should have, some type of animal health program which it subscribes to for prevention and treatment, requiring considerable amounts of man-hours and drug expense annually. A large portion of morbidity and mortality in the feedyard is caused by shipping stress. Cattle, which are shipped long distances, have been subjected to excessive handling as well as environments rich in pathogenic organisms in the receiving and handling pens. Other stressors include withdrawal of feed and water, long periods without rest and finally subjection to diesel fumes while on the truck. Physiologically, these animals are tired, weakened and dehydrated, having lost substantial levels of vitamins and electrolytes while in transit. This produces an environment within the animal that is lower in immunological activity than that of nonstressed animals and is therefore perfect for the propagation of pathogens.
This lowered resistance is enhanced by the co-mingling of cattle from various origins and the resulting subjection to infectious agents to which they may not have developed a natural immunity. These cattle are excellent candidates for any of the host of feedlot diseases commonly observed which ultimately result in death losses. Many times the feedyard manager implicates the consulting veterinarian and his health program for all death losses in the yard. While the veterinarian does have a large responsibility concerning newly received cattle as well as the overall health program in the yard, there are areas affecting cattle mortality where he has only limited impact.</dc:description>
