	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Respiratory disease causes the highest economic loss of feedlot diseases. Diagnosis of infectious diseases occurring in feedlot environments tends to focus primarily on respiratory pathogens. The role of viral entities, including infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), parainfluenza-3 (PI3), and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), in conjunction with Pasteurella hemolytica in respiratory disease is well documented. They are generally regarded by veterinary clinicians as the primary pathogens involved in feedlot respiratory disease. Presence and involvement of other pathogens has been acknowledged and documented. However, their importance, incidence, pathogenicity, and cost to the industry are less well understood.
Diagnostic investigations involving feedlot pathogens of lesser overall economic importance are important in order to address issues including therapy, prevention, and prognosis. Unusually high morbidity and/or mortality in some animal populations give them critical importance in some cases. Client education is also important in order to communicate occurrence of losses that at times mimic more common disease entities or present new diagnostic challenges.
Mycoplasma bovis and Hemophilus somnus are two organisms that produce clinical and subclinical disease resulting in feedlot morbidity and mortality, with accompanying economic loss.</dc:description>
