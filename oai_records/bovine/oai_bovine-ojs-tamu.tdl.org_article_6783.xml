	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The implications of science and technology for society and government have grown enormously over the last few decades and will continue to do so. Geographical borders are less relevant today than locations and considerations of trading partners. The global economy has overshadowed any single national economy, and scientific and technical advances are leaving past animal health practices and policies obsolete. In many countries, animal agriculture is management of these risks within the framework of fair trade is inexorably forcing animal health officials and practitioners to reconsider past policies and programs, the methods of decision-making, legislative guidelines, and the delivery of services directed to animal health. Besides changes in global markets, new sensitivities and constituencies are developing that are profoundly influencing agricultural policy. Together, these issues are molding a new domestic policy that will evoke a new ethos and ethics in food animal agriculture and the veterinary profession.
First, we will examine these contemporary issues in more depth. Then, we will consider how these issues affect our profession and you personally. Finally, we will look at prescriptions for change and how veterinary medicine collectively and you and I, personally, can consider appropriate strategies to be well positioned in the year 2000.
The forces reshaping agriculture will continue to foster a climate of change and new opportunity for veterinary medicine. These major forces include new markets and trading partners, new constituents, changes in domestic policy, and changes in decision-makers, especially Congress. Now, and in the future, we will continue to face critical choices that will determine the future and quality of new services because of the strength of these forces. A new veterinary ethos and ethics is demanded.</dc:description>
