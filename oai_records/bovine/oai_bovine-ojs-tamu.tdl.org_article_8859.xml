	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The beef and dairy industries make significant contributions to sustainability objectives by providing our society with nutri­tious food, supporting farmers’ livelihoods, generating billions of dollars in economic activity, and contributing to healthy ecosystems. However, cattle production also generates negative environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emis­sions. Veterinarians have a unique opportunity to interface with beef and dairy farmers to assist with the implementation of products and practices that reduce GHG emissions, such that their clients can be more profitable and more sustainable. In general, the GHG intensity of beef and dairy production can be reduced by increasing output yields of beef and milk, while re­ducing inputs and maximizing efficiency. Some of the specific interventions include: early entry of feeder cattle to a feedlot, dry manure management, optimized inorganic nitrogen fertil­izer use, increased fat in the ration, use of anti-methane feed additives and ionophores, sourcing low-carbon corn, select­ing genetics for high feed efficiency, raising moderate/small mature beef cows and feed efficient dairy cows, improving pregnancy rate and reducing dystocia, conducting pregnancy checks, implementing artificial insemination, promoting herd health products and practices to reduce death loss, using growth-promoting implants, and utilizing SOP Lagoon®. As a trusted source of scientific information, veterinarians can be a conduit of information for producers and contribute to the ongoing effort to improve the resiliency of the beef and dairy industries.</dc:description>
