	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Veterinary technicians should have an understanding of how vaccines work and diseases for which cattle are commonly vaccinated. When the immune system responds to stimulation by an antigen contained in a vaccine, the animal actively acquires immunity. Attenuated (modified-live) or killed viruses or bacteria are antigenic; certain pieces (subunits) of bacteria are also antigenic. Vaccines must be handled with care, as sunlight, heat and disinfectants will decrease efficacy of vaccines. Animals which are malnourished, poorly housed, or otherwise under stress will have a decreased benefit from vaccination, as their immune systems will not properly respond. Vaccines in cattle are most commonly used to prevent respiratory, reproductive and clostridial diseases. Tetanus and blackleg are clostridial diseases. IBR, BVD, Pl3 and BRSVare viral respiratory and reproductive diseases which are commonly combined in one vaccine; the IBR and BVD components may be modified-live or killed. Brucellosis is not a common disease, but vaccination of cattle against brucellosis, a zoonotic reproductive disease ("Bang's disease") greatly facilitates interstate shipment. Products are available to vaccinate cattle against just about every infectious disease they can get, but not all available vaccines have proven efficacy. Decisions regarding vaccines to use on a particular farm should be based on the risks, management and unique needs of the farm. When properly selected, administered and used in conjunction with sound management practices, vaccination is a valuable tool to help maintain herd health.</dc:description>
