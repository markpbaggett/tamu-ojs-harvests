	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Veterinarians can play a very important role in disaster pre足paredness for their clients, as well as providing veterinary care to animals that have been injured during natural disas足ters. Disaster preparedness needs will vary based on the risks and type of disaster in a particular location. Here I will focus on preparedness and response to wildfires. Veterinarians can play a very important role in developing emergency prepared足ness plans for their clients, including developing decision trees, evacuation planning, go-kit supplies, animal identification, facility setup and leaving animals behind. Additionally, vet足erinarians are needed on the frontlines to triage, treat and/or humanely euthanize burned or injured animals, as well as for longer term treatment and therapy of survivable injuries.</dc:description>
