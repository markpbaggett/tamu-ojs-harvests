	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The bovine veterinary practitioner today is called upon to practice a strange type of medicine. All of us upon graduation took some type of oath, or accepted an obligation which in so many words stated that we may choose whom we wish to serve; however, once he has undertaken the care of a patient he must not neglect it. This could be interpreted as being obligated to do everything possible to assist our patients and render services to the best of our ability.
We have thus accepted an obligation to provide services which include sound advice based on scientific facts, for which the practitioner expects to be satisfactorily compensated. I personally feel the veterinarian should become more deeply involved and participate in the selection and supervision of the use of various growth promotants that are available to the industry today.
Since the bovine practitioner is called upon to treat a food producing animal, his drug selection today is not primarily based on drug efficacy or safety in the target animal, but must be selected on the basis of safety to man since man is the eventual consumer of the final product.</dc:description>
