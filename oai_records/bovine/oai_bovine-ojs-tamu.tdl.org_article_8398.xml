	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Beef consumers want to know more about the beef they eat. They are interested in how the animals are raised, how they are treated on farms, ranches and feedyards, and they want to be assured that the beef they put on their table comes from op­erations that use good animal welfare and husbandry as their guiding principle. The U.S. Cattle Industry Feedyard Audit recently received PAACO certification and is in the process of being utilized across the cattle feeding sector. The NCBA Feed­yard Welfare assessment served as the basis for the Feedyard Industry Audit. Since there is also an NCBA Stocker Assessment and an NCBA Cow-calf Assessment, one could surmise that those segments will soon have an audit as well. Veterinarians should take advantage of this opportunity to help their clients develop a robust animal welfare program.</dc:description>
