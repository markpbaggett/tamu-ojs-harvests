	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Ladies and gentlemen, I speak to you today as a businessman, pure and simple. As the marketing director for Merck's Professional Veterinary Products, I am responsible for returning a profit to my company for the products that we market to the veterinarian. These products are not selected randomly or by chance. They have a pedigree of research, reliability and quality. They are positioned in the market to return the best possible profit. Since veterinarians are independent businessmen, for the most part, you are fully aware of the need for profits to pay for the overheads in your business just as we are aware of their need in our business. You have also the added responsibility of improving the profitability of your clients' animal production operations.</dc:description>
