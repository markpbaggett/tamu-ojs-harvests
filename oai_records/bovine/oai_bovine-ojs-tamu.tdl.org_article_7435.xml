	<dc:description xml:lang="en">You have challenged me to talk about motivation as a producer's perspective and as I look at it - Motivation and Communications. I have to say to you that number one, we're all living in a different society and a different world and things are changing. I don't have to tell you that. David asked me if I would share with you some of the things that I experienced as the first woman president of a national cattlemen's association. I think Phoenix is my lucky city. I was installed into office here in Phoenix. Ten years ago it would have been difficult for a female to have tried to be president of a national cattlemen's association but the more interesting thing was, I didn't choose to run. I was asked to run for the office and there is a big difference.</dc:description>
