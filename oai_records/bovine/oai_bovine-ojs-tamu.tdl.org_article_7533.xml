	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Selling your practice is a people problem. Selling your practice is marketing. Marketing can be divided into two areas. One is the controversial area of advertising or merchandising through the media in a competitive way your prices, your services, your products, your whatever. The second area o marketing is what I'm interested in discussing today and that is simply AWARENESS-making the client aware of what services you can provide for him and what benefits he can be assured of receiving should he choose to become a client of yours. And remember, it is his choice. Nobody makes him come to your office. You may be the only game in town, but unless you adequately meet that client's needs, he can decide to either go many miles for better service or to do without veterinary service altogether. It's his choice. If you're going to be his choice, you're going to have to meet both his expectations and his needs.</dc:description>
