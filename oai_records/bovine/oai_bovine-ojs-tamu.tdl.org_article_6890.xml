	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Rate and efficiency of postweaning growth are important components of beef production. About 30% of the energy requirements and about 45% of the total feed costs are incurred in the period between weaning and slaughter. Historically, when steers were finished on pasture, propensity to finish at a young age was desirable, particularly when market requirements for fatness were great. However, propensity to fatten became a handicap as we shifted to increased use of grains in diets of growing-finishing cattle. Recently, customer pressure to reduce caloric and fat content of beef and other red meats has intensified because coronary heart disease is believed to be associated with elevated blood cholesterol levels. Dietary control of the type and amount of fat consumed is strongly recommended by members of the medical profession in an attempt to regulate blood cholesterol levels. In this paper, results from the Germ Plasm Evaluation (GPE) program at the Roman L. Hruska U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, Nebraska are reviewed on relative amounts of genetic variation between and within breeds in growth, feed efficiency and quantity and distribution of lean, inter- and intramuscular fat, and caloric content of retail cuts of beef with different degrees of trimming.</dc:description>
