	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Feeding feces is by no means a new concept, even though it has only recently received publicity due to public concern as it fits in the overall picture of environment pollution abatement. Early in the 1940's cow manure was looked upon as a source of B-complex vitamins. Hammond (1942) reported on studies in which cow manure was used as a source of certain vitamins for growing chickens and later (Hammond, 1944) where cow manure or dried rumen contents was substituted for alfalfa meal in poultry diets. Bohstedt, Grummer, and Ross (1943) used cattle manure as a carrier of B-vitamins in rations for pigs. Lillie, Denton, and Rind (1948) demonstrated that cow manure contained a growth factor giving essentially the same gain response in chicks as crystalline B12.</dc:description>
