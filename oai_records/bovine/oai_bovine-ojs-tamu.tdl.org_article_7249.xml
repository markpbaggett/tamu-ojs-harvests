	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors for an emerging hoof lesion in growing heifers and adult dairy cattle with no prior reports in the peer-reviewed literature. Corkscrew claw syndrome (CCS) is not the corkscrew claw that we used to see affecting the rear lateral claws of multiparous cows who were victims of poor housing and hoof care. Nor is it the mild corkscrew of the front medial claw that we commonly recognize. Rather, corkscrew claw syndrome is the combination of corkscrew deformities of the medial claws of both the rear and front feet in combination, and it occurs in heifers predominantly, rather than older cows. The condition can be so severe by the time that the heifer calves, the rear medial claw is the dominant weight bearing claw. The anatomical changes that result in this condition appear to be permanent and unrepairable. The pedal bones are irreversibly changed, developing bony exostoses and becoming narrower and rotated within the claw capsule. For that reason, affected herds will see this syndrome affecting all age groups, starting in growing age heifers and following through all the way to the oldest cows in the herd.</dc:description>
