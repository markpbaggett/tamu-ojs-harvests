	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The loss of dairy calves from stillbirths and disease-related deaths places a significant challenge on the producer who wants farm-specific replacement heifers to maintain or expand herd size. Stillbirths are often overlooked as an important cause of calf mortality, as they are on some dairies. With improved record keeping, data analysis, diagnostic testing and herd monitoring, the appropriate risk factors for stillbirth can be broken down and targeted for improvement. The classification of stillbirths will need to be broadened, however, and the role of maternal stress, metabolic disorders, fetal growth factors and environmental exposure may need attention to solve this growing cause of calf mortality. Solving disease related death problems in dairy calves requires a broad approach that looks not only for the disease agents but for the sources of infection, opportunities to improve immunity and changes that can reduce the susceptibility of calves. Once affected, the difference between disease morbidity and calf mortality is early detection and appropriate intervention with effective treatment protocols. Colostrum management, health screening, diagnostic testing, overview of bedding management, feeding consistency, simplicity, as well as the implementation of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies bring the veterinarian to the forefront of reducing calf morbidity and mortality.</dc:description>
