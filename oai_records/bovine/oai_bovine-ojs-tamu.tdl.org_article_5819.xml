	<dc:description xml:lang="en">My work as a veterinarian began in a general mixed practice. The practice had a heavy dairy component, and I became involved in providing reproductive services. I'm not sure if I could pinpoint a moment in time when I thought I had been transformed from a reproductive veterinarian to a consulting or a production or a performance medicine veterinarian. I'm still not sure what my proper title should be, or even if I'm there yet. I feel the evolution has progressed well, but when I look back, I realize I have been practising for 20 years.
There have been many influences that have propelled me down the road toward a consulting practice. Some of these influences were from within my previous multi-person, multi-discipline practice. Some were external, such as the changing economies of the modern dairy industry, and some of the influences were personal, with a desire to be more involved with the well being of my dairy clients.
One of the influences was frustration. Much like a dog chasing its tail, it seemed that just as I was poised to conquer one aspect of the dairy management puzzle, another challenge (opportunity) seemed to emerge.</dc:description>
