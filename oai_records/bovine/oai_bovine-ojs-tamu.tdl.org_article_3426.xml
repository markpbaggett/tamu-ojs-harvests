	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Feeding systems need to be monitored and evaluated just like milking systems. A TMR Audit® is a systematic approach designed to evaluate the feeding program. The objectives are to look for ways to minimize variation between the formulated and consumed ration, minimize shrink, and to improve the efficiency of the feeding system. Areas evaluated include silage and feedstuff management, TMR load preparation, TMR consistency within and between loads, and feedbunk management. Management procedures should be in place to minimize top spoilage of silage stored in bunker silos and with other feedstuffs, and feeding personnel should be trained that spoiled feed needs to be discarded, not fed. Due to variation in DM and nutrient content across the face of the silo and across bales of hay or balage, it is best to premix an individual forage prior to using that forage in preparing a load of TMR. The Penn State Particle Separator can be used to evaluate TMR consistency. We have identified 10 primary factors that can lead to variation within and between loads of TMR. These factors include the following: worn equipment, mixing time, load size, levelness of mixer during mixing, loading position on the mixer box, hay or straw quality and processing, loading sequence, liquid distribution, vertical mixer auger speeds, and hay restrictor plate settings in vertical mixers. Feed efficiency can be improved by feeding multiple times per day as opposed to once daily. Feed push-ups need to be done frequently enough to ensure easy access to feed along the entire feed bunk. TMR Audits can help to improve performance and health on the dairy.</dc:description>
