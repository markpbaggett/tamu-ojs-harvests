	<dc:description xml:lang="en">As usual Canada is last! Just remember it is bigger than all these twelve districts put together. What I want to do is show you some slides that we made with the help of Drs. Hamilton and Paul Greenough of the kinds of things that technicians do in our veterinary college in which we are helping to train veterinary technicians or animal technicians in conjunction with the Institute of Technology in Saskatoon. I am not sure how many accredited schools we have in Canada. Probably six or seven. I think there are three in Ontario, perhaps two in Alberta, one in Saskatchewan. Most of the animal technicians that are being graduated in Canada are not going into large animal practice. They are going into animal science departments, biology departments, small animal practice. A very small number are going into large animal practice.</dc:description>
