	<dc:description xml:lang="en">We are hearing from all sides about pollution. It is as if the word was new and that pollution is a modem phenomenon. Terms like "recycled" and "biodegradable" are used by the press and the public as something new and something that we must get with. As a result, animal agriculture is under public suspicion and the industry is being pressured to relocate livestock facilities.
I think it appropriate that we consider care fully the basic causes of this problem. What are the parameters and what can and cannot be done about them? My purpose today is to discuss these as related to pollution in the area of biodegradables only. I would like to start with a quotation from that contemporary newspaper philosopher "Pogo" who was recently quoted as saying, "We searched and searched and searched and finally found the enemy. It is us." I think this bit of philosophy directly applies to biological pollution and the problems we are facing today</dc:description>
