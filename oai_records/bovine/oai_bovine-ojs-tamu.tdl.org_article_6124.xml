	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A significant disease problem of cattle characterized by sudden onset of acute respiratory distress shortly following a change in feed or forage has been known for a number of years. The disease syndrome was described as early as 1830 in Europe and there has been numerous subsequent reports from many areas of the world (17). The disease has many synonyms, but is generally referred to as Acute Bovine Pulmonary Emphysema (ABPE) in the Pacific Northwest and western intermountain regions of the United States. In the Midwest it is often designated as bovine adenomatosis. In other areas of the United States and in several other English-speaking countries it is referred to as a typical interstitial pneumonia of cattle. Local terms that are often used by ranchers and veterinarians include cow asthma, green grass sickness, summer pneumonia, lungers, grunters, panters, and others.</dc:description>
