	<dc:description xml:lang="en">We have heard from four people today and I think it is my role to stick some needles in people and get something going! We have heard from four vastly different people with quite different views. Dr. Young and Dr. Rinker are two veterinarians but both employed in the same industry but in a somewhat different position. One of the things that I have seen over the years is some deficiencies that exist in veterinarians as a result of their great training, veterinary colleges, and also because it seems to me that we become creatures of habit-we do our thing-we practice conventionally for awhile and it seems to me that the kind of endeavor has been discussed today requires a sort of retreading of attitudes and objectives and a basic thinking.</dc:description>
