	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper deals with the enviromental impact deriving from the presence of widespread farming activities in the Po Valley which, owing to its geologic characteristics, is particularly vulnerable to pollutants. From the schematic hydrogeologic map of the Po Plain shown in the text, the prevailing presence of alluvial deposits is evident. These deposits, due to their grain-size characteristics, are often interested by the presence of vast amounts of groundwaters which are an important resource for man since they are widely exploited for watersupply and irriguous purposes. The high permeability of a great part of these deposits makes them particularly vulnerable to pollutants, also considering that the Po Valley shows one of the highest concentrations of industry and farming not only in Italy but in the whole of Western Europe. In particular, for what concerns animal breeding, the data collected show that the pollutants' load derives mainly from cattle farms which are, therefore, one of the main sources of potential pollution of the aquifers. Indeed, the hydrochemical analysis of groundwaters in the Po Valley has confirmed in many cases the presence of pollutant concentrations above legal levels, owing to an inadequate management of farm-sewage. In order to upgrade the environmental situation it is necessary to apply strictly the existing norms and to improve the depuration and waste-disposal techniques aiming at a management more compatible with the physical characteristics of the territory.</dc:description>
