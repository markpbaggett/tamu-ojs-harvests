	<dc:description xml:lang="en">There is accumulating evidence that the use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals has adverse human health consequences. The use of these drugs in food animals selects for resistant pathogens and resistance genes that may be transferred to humans through the consumption or handling of foods of animal origin. Recent studies have demonstrated that antimicrobial resistance among foodborne bacteria may cause excess cases of illness, prolonged duration of illness, and increased rates of bacteremia, hospitalization and death.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is committed to resolving the public health impact arising from the use of antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals. The FDA's goal is to ensure that significant human antimicrobial therapies are not compromised or lost while providing for the safe use of antimicrobials in food animals. The FDA published a guidance document titled "Evaluating the Safety of Antimicrobial New Animal Drugs with Regard to their Microbiological Effects on Bacteria of Human Health Concern" that outlines a pathway drug sponsors can use to address concerns about antimicrobial resistance prior to approval of their drug. 30 The process uses a qualitative risk assessment approach to assess the potential of the intended use of a product to develop resistance in bacteria that may harm humans. The level of risk determines the level of risk management that is required for the drug to be approved.</dc:description>
