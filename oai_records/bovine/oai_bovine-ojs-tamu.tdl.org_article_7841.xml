	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Milk and meat production have become more dependent on the increased use of concentrates in the ration and whether these practices will continue with the known problems that exist and altered rumen fermentation that occurs, is dependent upon the continued advantage of use and solutions to modify the problems of high-concentrate rations.
Rations that consist of primarily roughage provide enough energy to maintain the average annual milk production of approximately 10,000 lbs. per cow in the United States, but most cows have a genetic potential for more milk production and this can be obtained by increased use of grain. Kansas Dairy Herd Improvement records indicate the advantage of concentrate feedings for increased milk production.
When dairy cows are fed high levels of concentrates, major changes in the rumen environment occur. Some of these changes are detrimental as described in the previous disease conditions. Numerous attempts have been made to use rumen buffers to counteract some of these negative effects (15,16,17,31).
The effects of these buffers on volatile fatty acids, lactate production, and metabolism have been variable. If appropriate levels of supplementation can be determined, they may be useful in combating the negative effects of high-concentrate feeding.</dc:description>
