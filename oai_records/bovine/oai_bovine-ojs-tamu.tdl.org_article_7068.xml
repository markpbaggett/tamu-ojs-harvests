	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The veterinary profession, particularly veterinarians who earn their living from any species where economics rather than emotion dictates their income, are facing challenging times. We have an opportunity unlike any time in the recent past to change the way we do business and meet the needs of an increasingly sophisticated client and the complex health problems which occur on more and more intensive livestock operations. For the past ten to fifteen years, the veterinary profession has embraced and promoted the concept of "herd health," and told innumerable students to go out and sell the concept. I'm sure many people in this audience have felt the frustration associated with taking this idea and putting it into practice. If we truly believe this is the approach to take, then it is essential that the veterinary profession identify clients who will accept these principles and provide the enthusiasm and the technical expertise to make this occur. One of the most common problems encountered in selling herd health has been in being paid appropriately for services which are not all of the task-oriented type.</dc:description>
