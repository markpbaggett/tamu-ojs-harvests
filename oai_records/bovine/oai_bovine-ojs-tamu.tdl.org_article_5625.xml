	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The widespread use of AI in beef cattle is strictly dependent upon development of effective methods to control estrus. Many methods to manipulate the estrous cycle in beef cattle have been developed and are available for use in AI programs within the industry. However, less than 10% of beef females in the USA are bred by AI. Many factors have contributed to the low degree of adoption of AI technology by beef producers. These factors include but are not limited to tradition, the marketing system for the industry, the extensive, low-input nature of many of our beef production systems and the degree of efficacy of existing estrous control methods. The economic advantages of an effective AI program have been well-defined in the past and the movement of the beef industry towards value-based marketing has heightened the importance of the use of AI. The effective use of current methods of estrous cycle manipulation and the development of future systems with improved efficacy are critical to expansion of the use of AI in beef cattle.</dc:description>
