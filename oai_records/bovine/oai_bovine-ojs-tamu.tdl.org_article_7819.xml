	<dc:description xml:lang="en">When dealing with factors that are associated with feedlot diseases we are primarily concerned with infectious agents, also nutrition, and we use or consult a nutritionist on our problems. We try to eliminate as much stress as we possibly can by providing a better environment for the cattle as they come in, but the top of this thing is management. Under management we are dealing with a lot of different types of people, a lot of different personalities and we have to learn to deal with these people and how to work with them and how to handle them. So, a consultant veterinarian is a teacher. He is a supervisor and he is an advisor. He is a diagnostician. He does do some of the treatment, but the main thing is that he has to be able to get along with people to get the work done and the chain of command in a feedyard is tremendous. You have the general manager, a manager, an assistant manager, office people, office managers, feed mill, feed mill manager, and the yard foreman and his people. The yard foreman and the assistant manager are basically the people I work with.</dc:description>
