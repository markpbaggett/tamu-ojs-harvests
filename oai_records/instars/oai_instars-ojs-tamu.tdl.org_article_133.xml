	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mosquitoes are potentially one of the most deadly animals in the world. They are known to vector diseases such as Yellow fever and West Nile virus. Surveying urban areas is important fo ridentifying what species of mosquitoes are present in order to dtermine what potential diseases are present in the eniornment. The focus of this experiment was to identify what species were present in the Bryan/College Station, TX area. Mosquito larvae were captured by allowing the females ot oviposit in previously placed containers and were monitored over the course of two months. By properly identifying the species of local mosquitoes, prevention methods can be taken into account in order to lower mosquito prevalence and ultimately lowering the chances of mosquito-borne diseases.</dc:description>
