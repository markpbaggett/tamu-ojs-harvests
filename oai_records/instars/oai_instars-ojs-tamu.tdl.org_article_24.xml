	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mosquito-borne diseases are responsible for millions of hospitalizations and deaths worldwide each year. Many species with a high vectorial capacity for diseases such as West Nile virus, St. Louis and eastern equine encephalitis, and dog heartworm are endemic to the southern U.S. The different mosquito species can be found in a broad spectrum of environments, ranging from nearly clean water to brackish runoff. Certain mosquito species have a preference as to where they lay their eggs, including standing, or permanent water species, as well as floodwater, or temporary water species. Four different locations were sampled for the presence of mosquito larvae. Some collected larvae were preserved immediately and the rest reared out to adults before they were identified down to genus and species. Mosquitoes from the genus Aedes, Culex, and Psorophora were identified, with Aedes species being the most common. Identification of the different species collected is important in helping to understand the various habitats these mosquitoes breed within in order to properly develop specific control methods to reduce populations. Knowing the species that are present in a location is also essential in identifying the different diseases that might be present, as different mosquito species are vectors for different pathogens. The knowledge of what pathogens are in an area can help raise awareness about the importance of mosquito prevention, control, and what symptoms to look for if a person falls ill with a suspected mosquito-borne disease. This survey served to identify some of the common species of mosquito present in various locations in the Bryan and College Station area.</dc:description>
