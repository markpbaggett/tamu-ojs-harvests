	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, are known to be household pests and a potential danger to small children and animals. Fire ants are particularly a problem in the state of Texas because of the $1.2 billion cost in damages associated with fire ant activity. Wildlife, agricultural, and urban areas are prone to fire ant infestation, and the fire ants can cause several problems to plants and animals in that area. Â The purpose of our study was to find effective, common household products that can function as a repellent of the insect. Using baby powder, cinnamon, and petroleum jelly as individual barriers between the fire ants and honeydew melon, it was found that petroleum jelly and baby powder were the best repellents. Lastly, the cinnamon powder, while effective, was the worst of the three repellents tested. In the future, other common household items should be tested for their efficacy at repelling Solenopsis invicta, but based on our results, it has been found that both petroleum jelly and baby powder are effective repellents of red imported fire ants.</dc:description>
