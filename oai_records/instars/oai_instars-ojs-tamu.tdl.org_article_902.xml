	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Footwear impression evidence plays a significant role in criminal investigations and forensics. In almost all instances of crimes, the perpetrator is wearing footwear, and in many of these cases, trace impressions are left in the ground. The shoe prints left behind can either be in printing mediums such as dirt, or flat prints made up of blood or dust. These shoe prints can be photographed or cast and used as class evidence. Damage to the bottom of the shoe, the outsole, can lead to more individualized shoe prints. These damages occur at different rates depending on the physicality of the conditions that the outsoles are subject to. High intensity use of the shoes can lead to quicker individualized damages that can be observed and documented as evidence against the perpetrator. This paper describes the experiment used to measure the damages that occur to the outsole over time, and what activities will lead to higher rates of outsole individualization. This experiment used one pair of shoes specifically for walking only, and another used for rougher activities. The shoe prints made by these shoes were compared to see how the activities affected the outsole over a period of four weeks.Â The shoe designated for running degraded at a quicker rate and therefore left a more individualized print behind.</dc:description>
