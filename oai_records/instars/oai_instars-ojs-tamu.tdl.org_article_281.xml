	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Determining the most prevalent parasitic worms found in canines surrounding the Bryan/College Station Area</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Parasitic worm incidences are common in canines but can typically be contained with existing treatments. When not contained, these can go on to infect humans and cause different medical problems depending on the parasite. Therefore, further researching was conducted on the following parasitic worms in canines, Isospora (coccidia), Toxocara canis (roundworms), Trichuris vulpis (whipworms), Dipylidium caninum (tapeworms), and Ancylostoma caninum (canine hookworm). We decided to test canine fecal samples to determine the prevalence of each in the Bryan/College Station area. The samples collected were tested for the presence of oocytes and eggs from parasitic worms using Fecasol solution as part of a fecal flotation test. The results indicated over half of the samples collected tested positive for a parasitic worm infection of a certain species. The highest number of positive cases were from those infected with hookworms. In canines with more than one parasitic worm, the most common grouping was hookworms with roundworms. This research emphasized the need for greater public awareness on worm treatments to prevent possible spread to humans via zoonotic disease and to maintain dog health. This information can also be included as part of a public awareness campaign to address the risks of canine to canine transmission and canine to human transmission when dogs are not treated with preventatives. </dc:description>
