	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this experiment was to determine the species of cockroaches that infest different parts of homes located in north Houston. To do this, cockroach traps were laid out in different rooms of the house. Each night for one week, and the specimen caught within the past twenty-four hours were removed from the traps and their species were determined. The number of cockroaches caught per location per night was recorded. It was concluded that the most prevalent species infesting houses in Houston, Texas was the Periplaneta americana cockroach, commonly known as the American cockroach (Insect Identification 2016). The most infested area of the house was determined to be the attic.</dc:description>
