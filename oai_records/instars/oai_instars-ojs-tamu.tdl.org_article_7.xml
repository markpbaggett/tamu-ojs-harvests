	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mosquitoes are the deadliest vectors of human diseases, but are often unable to fly far distances from their place of emergence. Developed areas may have different species than nearby undeveloped areas due to this attribute of weak flying. This experiment involved setting out water sources at two nearby sites at each of three locations. These sites were then sampled for larvae that were identified. We identified Culex restuans (Theobald) (Diptera: Culicidae) at every single site (besides Location 3 Site 1 where our bucket was stolen). We also identified Toxorhynchites rutilus (Coquillett) (Diptera: Culicidae) at Location 1 Site 2. There was not enough information to determine a pattern with our data. It is suggested that more data be collected during years with more standard weather.Â </dc:description>
