	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Spotted wing drosophila, also known as Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) are invasive insects to crops and a nuisance to humans. Because of their prevalence, studies were conducted to determine the most optimal trapping solution. Types of vinegar and types of honey were tested to determine the most effective natural and non-toxic trapping solution. Five different 250 mL solutions either containing spring water, local honey, store-bought honey, regular vinegar, and apple cider vinegar contained in a red, plastic cup were tested for their effectiveness in trapping Drosophila suzukii. Specimens were strained from each trap solution after each trial and were recorded to determine which solution trapped the most flies. Overall, the trap containing apple cider vinegar was the most effective at trapping Drosophila suzukii. This data demonstrates that Spotted wing drosophila are most attracted to acidic solutions, and therefore, make the best home- made traps.</dc:description>
