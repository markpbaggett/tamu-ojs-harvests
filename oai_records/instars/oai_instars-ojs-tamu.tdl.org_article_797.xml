	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Plant owners living in the Bryan/College Station area have observed a lack of growth and wilting of their potted plants after being watered with College Station water. Contaminants in College Station tap water, such as trihalomethanes (TTHMs) and Haloacetic acids, may influence plant growth. Two six-inch-long pieces of Epipremnum aureum (Alismatales: Araceae) golden pothos were cut from a mother plant to be used in the experiment, where the root growth was measured over 22 days with one cutting in purified water and one in tap water. An unpaired t-test determined an insignificant p-value (p=0.8807). These results indicate that root growth in store-bought water and sink water was not statistically significant, demonstrating to plant owners in the College Station area that watering their plants with tap water does not have a statistical effect on their growth.
Key words: Golden pothos, sodium, root growth</dc:description>
