	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study investigates the impact of various substances on the clarity and readability of fingerprint impressions, a vital part of forensic science. The primary objective is to evaluate how substances such as lotion, hand sanitizer, foundation, and Clorox wipes influence the quality of fingerprints. It is hypothesized that lotion and foundation will cause the greatest degradation, while hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes will have minimal effect. This experiment involved preparing controlled fingerprint impressions using an ink pad and fingerprinting cards, followed by the application of each substance. Fingerprints were evaluated based on a predefined clarity scale of 1 to 5 using high-resolution images. Each substance was tested twice per finger to validate consistency. Findings revealed significant variations in fingerprint readability, with lotion and foundation and foundation showing the highest degradation levels corroborating the hypothesis. This research underscores the importance of controlling environmental and external factors in forensic investigations. This study shows the effect of common substances on fingerprint quality, the study provides insights for improved evidence collection.</dc:description>
