	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Subsequent to a case of live flesh fly larvae (family Sarcophagidae) being found in commercially prepared fried chicken from a fast-food establishment, an experiment was conducted to determine the source of the contamination.&amp;nbsp; In this experiment, first-instar larvae of the red-tailed flesh fly, Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis (Fallen 1817) were transferred to fried chicken immediately after cooking and at ten-minute intervals over a one-hour interval, at which times temperature of the chicken was also determined.&amp;nbsp; Results demonstrated that flesh fly larvae were unable to survive in fried chicken at its initial temperature of 88℃ at the time of sale and also after 10- and 20-minutes when mean temperatures decreased to 47.2 and 41.7℃, respectively.&amp;nbsp; Mean temperatures of the chicken dropped to 33.7℃ during the 20- to 30-minute intervals post purchase and continued decreasing to 27.1℃ at the end of one the 50 minutes and to 26.5 at the end of one hour, during which times larva were able to survive and develop. It was concluded therefore that contamination could not occur within the commercial establishment, assuming the chicken was either sold immediately after cooking or that it was held under a heat lamp at an appropriate temperature after preparation and therefore must have resulted after its sale.</dc:description>
