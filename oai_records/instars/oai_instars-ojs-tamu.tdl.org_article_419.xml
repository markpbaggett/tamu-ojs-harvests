	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Effectiveness of Meat Tenderizer in Removal of Blood from Fabric</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Neuberger, Jacey Renee</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A technique involving bromelain-based, powdered meat tenderizer was used to remove stains caused by human blood from three common fabrics. Groups of fabric samples were stained with blood and treated with a meat tenderizer mixture for different amounts of time and compared to a control group treated with water alone. The results of this process suggested that meat tenderizer could be used to remove blood stains and that longer amounts of time were favorable for this method. Additionally, it was found that this technique differs from treatment with water alone by breaking down and transferring the stains from the fabric rather than just diluting them to reduce their appearance.</dc:description>
