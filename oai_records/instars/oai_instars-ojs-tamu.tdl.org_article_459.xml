	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The vast amount of mosquito in different bodies of water is very apparent in this region. These mosquitoes can transmit a multitude of diseases including Malaria, West Nile Virus, and Zika Virus. In this survey, mosquitoes were captured from various bodies of water in the Bryan/College Station area in order to determine which mosquitoes were more prevalent in these areas. Â The objective of this was to identify these species to understand what bodies of water in this area contain which species and therefore protect ourselves from. Mosquito larvae were attempted to be gathered from 4 different locations that were 4 different types of water in this region, however larvae were only successfully collected in one of our locations. Different tools and containers were used to obtain these samples including rearing containers, measuring cups, etc. From these locations, the species that was identified was the male Culex quinquefasciatus. Due to this species being the only one identified from the various locations, it was concluded that it is a prevalent one in the Bryan/College Station area.</dc:description>
