	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria, account for many deaths throughout the world each year.  It is therefore essential to become familiar with the species that vector these diseases, in order to take steps toward enhancing treatment and prevention.  Additionally, several competent vectors of some of the deadliest mosquito-borne diseases are known to inhabit the United States.  Due to its central location and favorable climate, the city of College Station is a good habitat for many species of mosquito.  The goal of this study was centered on discovering which species are abundant in the highly populated areas where students who attend Texas A&amp;amp;M University live.  Larvae were collected from small bodies of water in three of the most popular residential areas surrounding the campus.  Some specimens were reared out to the adult stage for identification, while others were killed as larvae to be identified.  It was found that each of the three collection sites held larvae of mosquitoes that are competent vectors of serious diseases. Species found include Anopheles quadrimaculatus (Say) (Diptera:Culicidae), Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Diptera:Culicidae), and Culex salinarius (Coquillett) (Diptera:Culicidae). Therefore, if the pathogens of these diseases were to arrive in College Station, many community members would be at risk of infection. </dc:description>
