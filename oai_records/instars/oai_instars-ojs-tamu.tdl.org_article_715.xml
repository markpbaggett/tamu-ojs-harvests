	<dc:title xml:lang="en">The Use of Bloodmeal as A Substitute for Fresh Blood in Forensically Important Fly Research</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Abstract: In the field of forensic entomology, it is incredibly important to be researching the impact that different environmental and bodily factors have on forensically important flies and their growth, development, and colonization of decaying remains. The evidence that these insects provide could be the difference between someone walking free and remaining in prison for the rest of their lives, so it is imperative that the science behind time of colonization calculations is up-to-date and accurate. Blood is often needed in research relating to forensically important flies, but it is often inconvenient and difficult to obtain, especially for researchers with few resources, such as undergraduate students. Blood meal, a form of dried blood, could be a breakthrough in overcoming these challenges, as it is a lot easier to obtain and store. If properly rehydrated, it could be used as an attractant for adults, a food source for larvae, and chemical additives could be put in it to study the effects of different chemicals on the attraction or growth rate of forensically important flies without having to worry about obtaining and using fresh blood.
