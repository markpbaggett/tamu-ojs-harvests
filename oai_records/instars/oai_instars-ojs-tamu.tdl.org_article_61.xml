	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Chrysomyia rufifacies (Macquart) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) and Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) are two Calliphorid carrion feeding species of significant importance in forensic investigations. Pupal weight was predicted to be an effective indicator of sex and species identification between the two related species when reared in a laboratory.Â  In order to test the effectiveness, wild maggots of both species were reared and the pupae of their offspring were weighed and sexed. There was no significant weight difference found between male and female pupae of both species. However when each species was compared to the other, it was observed that male and female pupae of Ch. rufaficies weighed significantly more than their C. macellaria counterparts. These results could simplify the identification of species at the pupal stage, thereby expediting research involving the two species.</dc:description>
