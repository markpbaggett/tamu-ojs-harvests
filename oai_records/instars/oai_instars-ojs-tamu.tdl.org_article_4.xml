	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Factors contributing to decomposing rates and insect succession include: wrapping, burying, or burning the corpse.  The purpose of this study was to determine whether the burning of a body would alter where insects would colonize the body and whether it would delay decomposition. One test chicken was blackened and charred on both sides and was compared to a control chicken. The control chicken was found in a late stage of active decay, while the test chicken was found skeletonized. Little to no fly activity was observed on the day of collection, however one Sarcophagidae adult was found on the control chicken and three fly species (Piophilidae (2 &amp;amp; 3rd instar larvae), Lucilia cuprina (1 adult), Ophyra (1 adult)) were identified from the test chicken.  Numerous beetles were found on both control and test chickens.  On the control chicken, adult Staphylinidae (14), adult Siliphidae (1), and adult Histeridae (12) were found.  On the test chicken, there were: adult Staphylinidae (3), adult Siliphidae (7), and adult Histeridae (9). The burning of the test chicken caused it to decompose faster, affecting succession of insects on the bodies. This explains the abundance of beetles on the test subject as compared to the control.</dc:description>
