	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Forensic Science is a continuously expanding field that incorporates the analysis of a multitude of variables in shoeprint and impression analysis. Footwear evidence is currently considered in crime scene investigations conducted by forensic experts. The research explores the differences in impressions and shoeprints with additional material added to the sole of shoe and whether the addition of these materials will have an effect on characteristic points on the sole of a shoe. In the experiment, three groups of results involving the effects of the addition of a plastic bag, an elastic shoe cover comprised of nylon, and duct tape are considered. The impressions and footprints were documented in photographic results that is compared to a control group of the research without any added materials. The data was analyzed through the observation of changes in the visibility in ten minutiae points of characteristics chosen before the beginning of the research. The results show that a nylon shoe cover has the smallest number of visible minutiae that correlates to being the technique of concealment of shoe impressions and prints that produces the most observable change in their visibility.</dc:description>
