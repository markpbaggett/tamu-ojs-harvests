	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Forensic Entomology and the Effect of Ortho Pesticide on Decomposition in Sunny Conditions</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Â A study of the effects of the use and type of insecticide on decomposition was conducted at the Rangeland Science Park in College Station, TX. A treated and a control chicken cadaver were laid out in the field in sunny conditions to observe decomposition and insect-cadaver interactions. We hypothesized that the use of insecticide would decrease the rate of decomposition compared to non-treated organisms and, specifically, that organisms treated with Ortho brand insecticide would have less insect activity than those treated with Spectracide. Results showed that the control cadaver was heavily decomposed while the treated cadaver was still in the early stages of decomposition. Both cadavers had insect activity, but fly larvae were more active on the control while adult flies were more active on the treated cadaver. Knowledge of factors that can affect decomposition is important because it can, consequently, affect post mortem interval estimates.</dc:description>
