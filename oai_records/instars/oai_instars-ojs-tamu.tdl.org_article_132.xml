	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Microorganisms have an ability to attach themselves to surfaces, where they then multiply and form a protective biofilm, which protects the microorganisms from outside influences, including chemicals for sanitation. This makes the cleaning of fly eggs for maggot therapy difficult. The purpose of this study was to test the toleration of Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae)eggs for agitation, which is used to degrade biofilms. Lucilia cuprina eggs were washed with insect saline and treated by undergoing five minutes of agitation. It was found that there was a significant difference between the control group, which did not undergo any agitation, and the treatment group, which did. This knowledge is useful for further testing of the extent to which agitation impacts survivability of the eggs and the debridement of the biofilm.Â </dc:description>
