	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Forensic Science is a continuously expanding field that incorporates the analysis of a multitude of variables in shoeprint and impression analysis. Footwear evidence is currently considered in crime scene investigations conducted by forensic experts. The research explores the difference in the characteristic points on the sole of a shoe with the addition of concealment materials in the creation of impressions and shoeprints. In the experiment, results of three treatments involving the addition of a plastic bag, an elastic shoe cover comprised of nylon, and duct tape are considered. The impressions and footprints were documented in photographic results that are compared to a control group without any added materials. The data was analyzed through the observation of changes in the visibility in ten minutiae points of characteristics chosen before the commencement of the research. The nylon shoe cover produced the smallest number of visible minutiae that correlates to being the technique of concealment of shoe impressions and prints that produces the most observable change in their visibility.</dc:description>
