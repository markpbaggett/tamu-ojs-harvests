	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The longevity of Chrysomya rufifacies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) was observed from adulthood until death to determine whether females or males lived longer.  Several Ch. rufifacies maggots were collected and fed cow liver for development.  Once these maggots emerged, these now adult flies were fed sugar and water.  When they reached full adulthood, additional liver was given to them, which served as a protein meal and, also, as a place to oviposit.  These maggots were reared in a laboratory setting until they pupated.  Approximately, 90 of a combination of males and females were gathered.  These were counted to see how many females (43) and males (47) were present.  Additional sugar and water was fed to them daily until they all died.  The data gathered were analyzed by using a T-test in SPSS by having P&amp;gt;0.05 as significant where males lived longer than females, and P&amp;lt;0.05 as insignificant where females lived longer than males.  The results showed that the P value came to be 1.619834569, which showed a great significance value.  This demonstrated that sometimes females died sooner than males. The figures below demonstrate the comparisons with both sexes and the longevity of each. </dc:description>
