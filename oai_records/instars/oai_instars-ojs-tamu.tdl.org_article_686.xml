	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper will be about the vandalism at the hullabaloo dorms that occurred on what was the night of Friday the 17th to the early morning of Saturday the 18th. Everyone that lives at the Hullabaloo dorms was sent a message on the morning of Saturday the 18th about a lot of vandalism that had occurred either the night before or that day. People were in rage to find out that if no one came forward they would all be splitting the price of what it cost to repair everything. They all had a lot to say about it and I figured I would try and get to the bottom of it in hopes of also not having to pay for an incident that I did not cause.&amp;nbsp;
