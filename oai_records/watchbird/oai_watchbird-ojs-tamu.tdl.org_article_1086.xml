	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Violet-eared Waxbill Uraegirubus granatina is the third of three types of Uraegirubus we will be discussing here. Although generally regarded as the most beautiful and desirable, this is purely subjective and open to argument. We have worked with Violet-eared Waxbills for many years and in personal observation have found them to be extremely over-rated and feel the price to be unjustifiably high. For our money, we would much rather invest in the Purple Grenadier Uraeginthu.s iantbinogaster. The Purple Grenadier, in our experience, is by far more intelligent, responsive and easily bred. For those of you determined to work with the Violet-eared Waxbill, be forewarned-breeding is generally very disappointing, success sporadic, and generationbreeding unheard of in this country.For the would-be breeder of this species, there are certain precautions and requirements about which you should be aware. The Violet-eared Waxbill is a solitary species and this trait must be respected. There must be just one pair to a flight. The flights do not have to be large, hut must be well isolated (out of sight and out of hearing) from flights containing other birds of the same species. We recommend a minimum flight size of 4 ft. long x 3 ft. high x 2 ft. wide.Unlike the Purple Grenadier, the Violet-eared Waxbills do not bond for life but only for the breeding season. This presents another challenge to the potential breeder of this species. They must be monitored continually, for either sex can attack its mate without....</dc:description>
