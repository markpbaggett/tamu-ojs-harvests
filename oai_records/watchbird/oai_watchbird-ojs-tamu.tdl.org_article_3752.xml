	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This corresponds with "The Red-billed Firefinch (Lagonosticta senegala) in Aviculture" article by Josef Lindholm, III, Curator of Birds, Tulsa Zoo on page 40 from Watchbird XLII ∙ Number 3 &amp;amp; 4 ∙ 2015. In Part I, the captions were inadvertently omitted from the following illustrations 1. This plate, by the distinguished natural history illustrator Henrik Groenvold (1858-1940), was first published in the January, 1923 number of the Avicultural Magazine, and subsequently appeared as the frontispiece of the first volume of the Avicultural Society’s book Aviculture, published in 1925, which also included the 1923 article by the French aviculturist Aime Decoux where he stated that the Red-billed Firefinch was” very commonly imported” though “delicate at first”, but “the best nester of all waxbills, and quite easy to rear”. Reproduced by kind permission of the Avicultural Society. 2. Plate 35 from Alexander Wilson’s American Ornithology, published from 1808-1814. Regarding the American Magpie in the center, Wilson wrote: ““The drawing was taken from a very beautiful specimen, sent from the Mandan nation, on the Missouri, to Mr. Jefferson, and by that gentleman presented to Mr. Peale of this city, in whose museum it lived for several months, and where I had an opportunity of examining it.” Josef Lindholm photo.</dc:description>
