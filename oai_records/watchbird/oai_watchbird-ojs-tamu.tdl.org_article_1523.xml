	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Striking new Brooder is exactly what breeders have been asking for.For some years Brinsea have been canvassing opinions about the ideal brooder for baby parrots and their new TIC-4 (Thermal Life-support Cabinet) is the outcome.Most obviously, the unit is round thus eliminating hard-to-clean corners. The circular shape is also strong, light and thermally efficient. The cabinet is of double-skin insulated construction. Note, too, how the clear door slides around the back within the width of the cabinet, requiring minimum space, not obstructing other equipment.More subtly, the new design addresses concerns about airborne pollution, tobacco smoke and cross contamination between brooders containing different species or bacteriological background. Birds have a very different respiratory system from mammals which makes them particularly sensitive to airborne impurities. The TIC-4 has an airflow system which draws fresh air though a high efficiency electrostatic inlet filter, where it is also humidified, and then circulates it gently through further stages of filtration into the bird chamber which is slightly pressurized, resisting the entry of unfiltered air. The principle is similar to that used in hospital operating rooms.Other features include electronic temperature control as standard - optocoupled to be highly secure against mains surges, digital thermometer, internal light and Brinsea's Ornnitherm™ heating system which warms the whole of the curved wall of the unit, ensuring gentle, even warmth.The internal size is 14" high x 15 1/2". (360mm h. x 394 dia.)The introductory price of the TLC-4 is just $349.95 including free two year guarantee.For further details call toll free: 1-888 667 7009, fax 407 321 6090Brinsea Products Inc.,3670 S Hopkins Avenue, Titusville, FL 32780 ~Dependable Humidity Management for IncubatorsNew H22 Humidity ModuleBrinsea Products Ltd. have developed their Humidity Module to provide an easily installed and easy to use controller of relative humidity (RH) in forced draught incubators. The electronically controlled module will work with most incubators ranging from 10 to 1000 hens egg capacity. A higher capacity version (H222) is available for larger incubators. Professional breeders and serious amateurs looking to improve quality can utilize this system to enhance their incubation management. The reliability and quality inher- ent to all Brinsea incubation and breeding products ensures that the Humidity Module will function accurately over long periods.Type H22 is a stand alone unit for use with the Brinsea Octagon 20 as well as other brands of incubators. The module contains a metering pump which delivers water to the incubator at a rate precisely matched to the humidity requirement of the incubator. All that is required to set up is to cut a small (1 in.) hole in the incubator wall through which the sensor and water inlet tube pass.System accuracy is maintained by the use of the latest American made precision bulk-polymer relative humidity sensor which eliminates hysteresis errors and has a long term accuracy better than 3%. No calibration is necessary and there is no wet bulb wick to dry out.Simple and inexpensive routine maintenance using easily obtainable supplies ensures that the Humidity Module can always give optimum performance. The compact module measures just 8" x 7".  </dc:description>
