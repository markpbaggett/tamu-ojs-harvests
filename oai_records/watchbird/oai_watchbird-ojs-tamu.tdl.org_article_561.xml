	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I am an aviculturist first because Ienjoy birds. Getting them to breed isalso very fulfulling, and I hope tohelp aviculture as a whole by workingwith and supporting endangeredspecies. Space, feed, housing, equipment,time and the birds themselvesare expensive, especially the rare orendangered ones! Money is one ofthe controlling factors in the kindand number of birds we can keep. Ahigh percentage of aviculturists haveto make the birds pay for themselvesas they cannot take that amount ofmoney from the family budget. Purchasingbirds from a family with ahistory of high productivity canmake the difference between successand failure.Working with a nonproducing pairof birds for three or four years oftenleads to discouragement and givingup, especially when an aviculturalfriend has a pair of the same kind producingin one or two years. I feel thatthere are two, maybe three things tolook for when purchasing birds, fromthe standpoint of productivity dealtwith in this article. 1) The tendencyto breed at a young age. 2) To havemultiple clutches. 3) Clutch size,though I have found that often thelast egg or two may be infertile, alsoif the last egg hatches too far behindthe first, the baby may not getenough food and be small or die. It ismy belief that these things are hereditary.</dc:description>
