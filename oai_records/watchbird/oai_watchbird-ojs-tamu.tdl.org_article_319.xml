	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Of course I did not intend to buy any birds. I was just planning to spend a pleasant afternoon with my family, attending the Gulf Coast Gamebird Breeders Bird Fair in Houston. And we did do just that. Looked at birds, talked with bird people and compared the relative merits of this bird and that. UNTIL I saw the black pigeons' Now I had never had one pigeon and really didn't have room for three - but there they were. Three lovely, glossy and funny-looking pigeons with short curved beaks, and feet with feathers at least an inch long covering the toes.</dc:description>
