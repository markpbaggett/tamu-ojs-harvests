	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The doctors were stumped. Lungcancer was on the increase with eachpassing year. Yet smoking of cigaretteswas diminished. Stricter pollutionstandards were imposed resultingin cleaner air. And levels of asbestos, aknown carcinogen, were muchreduced after it was banned fromhome insulation. Why were there somany new cases of lung cancer?The solution to this conundrum wasrevealed upon analysis of hospitaldata in three countries in Europe -The Netherlands, England and Belgium- countries that had a disproportionatelyhigh number of cases oflung cancer, and were increasing at afaster rate than their neighbors. Whatdid these nations have in common?In 1987, a group of Dutch lung specialistspublished a survey of lungcancer patients in four hospital centersat The Hague, The Netherlands. Theyfound that there was a sixfold increasein lung cancer in patients who keptbirds. Coincidentally, approximately70o/o of tropical bird aviculturists inEurope are located in The Netherlands,England and Belgium.Two additional reports from abroadhave recently appeared in the respectedBritish Medical Journal (October24, 1992) which support the connectionbetween aviculture and lungcancer which should raise concernamong everyone who keeps birds.A study from Germany found thatchronic exposure to birds in the previousfive years increased the likelihoodof lung cancer almost twice whencompared to individuals who had nosuch exposure. The risks increasedwith each year so that lung cancer wasthree times as likely after ten years ofbird keeping. A group of British doctorsfound a fourfold increase in riskof lung cancer associated with raisingpigeons.What is it about raising birds whichincreases the risk of developing lungcancer? No one knows for sure butthere are a number of possible reasons. People who keep birds areinhaling excess dust particles andfeather fragments which provoke areaction in human lungs. There arecells in the lungs called macrophages,whose job is to help remove foreignparticles and fight off infection, andwhich lose their normal functionwhen constantly exposed to thesesubstances. As a consequence, thereis less protection for lung tissueagainst infection and foreign particles.Moreover, substances are released bymacrophages upon exposure to particulatematter which cause an allergicreaction and scarring of lung tissue.Scarring (pulmonary fibrosis) is recognizedas a factor in causing lungcancer.There remain many unansweredquestions about birdkeeping and lungcancer. Does the risk vary dependingupon whether one is raising parrots,budgerigars, canaries or finches - orwhether one raises large numbers ofbirds at one time? Does it make a differencewhether birds are raisedindoors or out? More studies are necessaryto find these answers.Is there anything that aviculturistscan do to reduce or minimize the risk?Cigarette smoking remains the majorcause of lung cancer. Smoking producesmany of the pathologic changesin the lungs described above andalthough the risks of bird keeping canbe shown to be independent of smoking- the combination probably isadditive. So if you keep birds, don'tsmoke! Since passive exposure tosmoke also increases the risks of lungcancer, discourage anyone else inyour family from smoking. Furthermore,it would be prudent for those ofus who raise birds to wear an inexpensivepaper surgical mask when incontact with the birds (the masks canbe purchased in quantity at any pharmacy)to cut down on exposure to airborneparticles. A vi culture has manyjoys and many challenges and, with afew precautions, should not be hazardousto your health. •</dc:description>
