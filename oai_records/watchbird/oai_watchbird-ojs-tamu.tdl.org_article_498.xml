	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I suspect there is a growing numberof reader of Watchbird who, like I,dream of someday building wonderfulaviaries and filling them withprolific breeding pairs of all thespecies of birds we have ever desiredwhile, in reality, we are faced withthe· challenge of providing the bestpossible care for our birds in anindoor and , in fact , a highly urbansetting. We are constrained by busywork schedules , space limitations,and the fear that noisy birds willupset the neighbors next door, oracross the hall. I do believe that, evenin these situations, with careful planningand careful selection of species,it is possible to enjoy keeping birdsthat will thrive in an indoor environmentand reward their keepers manytimes over with good health , fascinatingbehavior, companionship, andbreeding uccesses. If you , like I, arean indoor aviculturist and find yourselfleafing through bird books forspecies that catch your eye then mayI sugge t you consider the Australianlong-railed parakeets of the genus Polytelis: the Barraband 's parrot, therock pebbler, and the Princess ofWales. They are often described as" the ideal aviary birds" but it is noroften recognized what affectionateand gentle pets they can be as well. Ihave kept all three of these beautifulbirds as tame pets over the past threeyears, and Jove them to no end.These three species of Polytelis, orthe polytelids, as they are genericallycalled, range broadly through Australia: the Barraband 's parrot inhabitseucalyptus forest to semi-open landin southwestern Australia, the rockpebbler is found in similar habitat insoutheastern Australia, and is sometimesseen in public parks in theSydney area. The Princess of Wales, incontrast , leads a highly nomadicexistence in the arid interior and ,therefore, is much less frequently observed in the wild . Each of thethree polytelids have well-establishedaviary populations in Australia andthe .S., so any young bird acquiredhere will have descended from afairly long line of captive-bred birds.</dc:description>
