	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Observations on Wild and Captive Mannikins And Their Allies</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Brickell, Neville</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">There are three logical speciesgroupsof the mannikin family. Halland Moreau consider the Red-headedFinch or Paradise Sparrow (Amadinaerythrocephala) and the Cut-throatFinch or Ribbon Finch (A mad ina fasciata)as belonging to this family ,comprising the first group. The Afri-can Silverbill (Spermestes [Lonchural malabarica) and the Pearl-headed Silverbill (Spermestes [Lonchural grisecapilla)form another; and the BronzeMannikin (Spermestes [Lonchuralculculata), Black and White Mannikin(Spermestes [Lonchural bicolor) andMagpie Mannikin (Spermestes [Lonchuralfringilloides) form the third. I have been studying mannikins andtheir allies in the field and in captivityfor over 30 years. These are common,highly gregarious species , living inpairs or small flocks and outside of thebreeding season they gathe r intolarger flocks. The typical mannikinsfavor moist, riparian fringing forestsand dense thickets whereas Cutthroatsand Red-heads live mostly indry aca cia savannas and disusedcultivation.Red-heads range from South Africato Namibia, Botswana, western Zimbabweto Angola. Cut-throats occur inSouth Africa, eastern Swaziland,southern Mozambique, Zimbabwe,Botswana, northern Namibia, Malawi,Kenya, eastern Tanzania to southeasternSudan and northern Nigeria and Senegal. I have not been fortunateenough to locate a nest of Cut-throatsin the wild. However, they have beenrecorded utilizing a wide variety ofnest sites from low down in a thickbush to 4.5 m up in a tree. Besidesconstntcting their own nest, they commonlyuse disused nests of weaversand have also been observed nestingin a post. My observation of two Redheadnests were in those discarded bySicial Weavers which were relinedwith feathers , wool and other softmaterials. They have also been recordedutilizing the nest of a Little Swift and a Cape Sparrow.The African Silverhill or WarblingSilverbill ranges from Tanzania toEthiopia, Somalia, western Sudanwestward to Senegal. The PearlheadedSilverbill or Grey-headedSilverbill is found from Tanzania,Kenya, Uganda to southern Ethiopia. Ihave not been able to locate the nestof an African Silverhill in the wild.Other observations have revealed thatnests are built of grass and have verticalside entrances which are thenlined with seeding grassheads, sometimesperched and sited in trees oflong grass. They also utilize old weavers'nests which are then relined. Twoinstances of wasps' nest associationhas been reported. My observation ofa Pearl-headed Silverhill's nest consistedof a large, untidy dried grassstructure placed beneath the roof of ahut and lined with goat hair and a fewfowl feathers.The Bronze Mannikin or BronzewingedMannikin occurs from Senegalon the west coast to Ethiopia on theeast coast, southward to Angola andSouth Africa and is also found on theoffshore islands of Fernando Po,Principe, Sao Thome, Pemba, Zanzibarand Mafia. The Black and WhiteMannikin or Blue-billed Mannikinranges from South Africa to Zambia,Zimbabwe, Zaire, Angola, Tanzania,Ethiopia, Sudan westward to Cameroon,Nigeria, Guinea and Liberia. TheMagpie Mannkin or Pied Mannikinranges from Senegal eastward tosouthern Sudan, Cameroon, Gabon,northern Zaire, western Uganda,Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya,Mozambique and South Africa.The Bronze-winged Mannikin constructsa large spherical ball of grasslined with seeding grassheads. Anentrance hole is situated on one sidewith a few stalks protruding, givingthe impression of a short tunnel.Roosting nests are much thinner andmore flimsy than breeding nests. Awide variety of nest sites have beenrecorded such as in trees, bushes, inthe thatches of huts, on security lightsupports and they are also known toreline the old nests of weavers. Myown observations were in palms, analoe and a relined Cordon Bleu nest.In West Africa, they have beenobserved to build close to nests of thevicious Red Tree Ant, apparently forprotection.</dc:description>
