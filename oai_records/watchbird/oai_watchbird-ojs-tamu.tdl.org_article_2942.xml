	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The American Cockatiel Society will hold their First National Cockatiel Specialty Show in conjunction with the National Cage Bird Show in Atlanta, Ga. on November 16, 17, 18 and 19, 1978.To insure the success of this First National Cockatiel Specialty Show, the participation and support of all aviculturists specializing in cockatiels is vitally necessary. This show can only be as great as the effort and work which is put into it by all of us who wish to promote our beautiful cockatiels, and this is your opportunity to show your birds in the biggest and the best show! A.C.S. hopes to have cockatiels at this Specialty Show from all areas of the U.S., so plan to bring your birds and represent your State. Shipped in birds will also be accepted. There will be classes for all cockatiel types and an outstanding array of handsome trophies and awards will be offered for all prize winning birds. If entries of cockatiels are more than 75, Kellogg will award a beautiful trophy, so this should be an added incentive to show your birds! For further details on classifications and trophies, contact the A.C.S. Show Coordinator. Judging of the cockatiels will be done by a qualified breeder and fancier approved and sanctioned by the A.C.S.The sum of $500.00 is needed for the Trophy Fund and I solicit your contribution to this fund in any amount you wish to give. Contributions should be mailed to American Cockatiel Society, c/o Jo Hall, Route I, Box 33, Thorndale, Texas 76577. All contributors will be acknowledged in the National Show Catalog and A.C.S. Bulletin. On behalf of the American Cockatiel Society, I appeal to you for your support, participation and contributions to help make this First National Cockatiel Specialty Show a truly exciting memorable event and one that all cockatiel fanciers will want to continue as an annual event. I urge you to...</dc:description>
