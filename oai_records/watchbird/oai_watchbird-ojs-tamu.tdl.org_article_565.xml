	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I believe that my wife and I are thefirst people to breed a new mutationof Quaker Parakeets. They are cinnamonin coloration and are definitelydifferent in color from normalQuakers. The few people that I haveshown them to also agree that theyare very beautiful birds.My wife and I have been breedingQuaker Parakeets for about fiveyears. I became interested in themafter talking to Mike Underwood ofAvi-Sci pelleted diets. Mike said thatQuakers are easy to breed, makegood parents and the babies areexceptionally tame when hand-fed.We purchased a few pairs of Quakersfrom a bird farm in Florida and setthem up in a breeding situation.We had fairly good success andwere pleased with the birds and thebabies, which indeed were very tameand made affectionate pets.In April 1988, I noticed a differentlooking chick in one of our nestboxes. It had light yellow down,Â whereas the others had the normalgrayish-green down at hatching to afew weeks old.</dc:description>
