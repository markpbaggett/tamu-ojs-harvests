	<dc:description xml:lang="en">My birds are certain spring has officially arrived. I have moved the nest boxes from the barn to the bird area and hope to have them all up within the nextweek or so. The amazon pairs glare at me when I enter the aviaries-they know the nest boxes are near and are anxious to get to work. Since some of the older pairs will foster chicks, nest boxes will be prepared for them too. Peppy and Doc, my first pair of Blue-fronted amazons, are close to 40 years of age. It has been a couple of years since they have had a chick oftheir own, but they are very content hatching and feeding a Golden Conure.This is also the time of year AF A shakes the cold off its shoulders and goes into high gear to complete the planning of our annual, educational conference and House of Delegates meeting. This year it will be held August 7 - 10 in Raleigh, NC. We have an exciting slate of speakers, and I especially look forward to hearing the message from our keynote speaker, Mark Hagen, and visiting with our Canadian guests.There is so much to offer at this year's educational conference. Don't forget the 2013 State ~arter Challenge! The Lory League will once again be hosting its annual hookbill show in conjunction with our conference. Our off site tours will include the Sylvan Heights Bird Park and the Museum ofN atural Sciences. And, if you know youths involved in birds, please encourage them to enter our AF A 4 Kidz essay contest.I am looking forward to renewing friendships and meeting first timers too!In friendship, NancySpeedÂ </dc:description>
