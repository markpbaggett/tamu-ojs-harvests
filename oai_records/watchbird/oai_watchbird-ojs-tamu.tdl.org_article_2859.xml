	<dc:description xml:lang="en">BUFF x BUFFFrom pure Buff all the progeny should be Buff.Buff is a recessive color and the progeny of a pair of pure Buff birds should result in 100% Buff. A real Buff color depends on the purity of the parent birds of this light color. Variation of color tone can range from Buff of almost "white-yellow" to a mealy lemon yellow. Any color deeper than this should be classified as ' 'yellow'' .YELLOW x BUFF75% Yellow, 25% Buff.The progeny of Yellow and Buff will come in Mendelian ratio of 25% dominant pure yellow with silky feather texture, 50% impure dominants comprising birds of varying tones of yellow but with more satisfactory contours, and 25% Buff. From the 50% group will come many show specimens but when bred these birds are likely to throw young of both Yellow and Buff.RECESSIVE WHITE x RECESSIVE WHITE100% White.These birds if they are pure Recessive Whites will produce all white progeny, and with birds of this classification a breeder should produce the best of white stock.RECESSIVE WHITE x YELOW 100% Yellow.Pure Yellow being a dominant color will, when bred with Recessive White, produce all yellow progeny. These will be heterozygous because they will contain blood of both Yellow and White birds. RECESSIVE WHITE x HETEROZYGOUS YELLOW (from YellowWhite ancestry)50% Yellow, 50% White.Owing to the fact that the Yellow parent has inherited genes from both White and Yellow parents the progeny will be 50% of each color.DOMINANT WHITE x DOMINANT WHITE (this is not a desireable mating) 25% Yellow, 50% White, &amp;amp; 25% White which usually die in shell or soon after hatching (non-viable).This mating usually begets in each four progeny, one yellow, two whites and nonviable white. This last named will usually die in the embryo state or soon after hatching.Â </dc:description>
