	<dc:description xml:lang="en">FOR THE LOVE OF GREYSby Bobbi Brinker, 49 photos or illustrations, 130 pages, soft cover, 8 1h x 11 inches, US - $30 includes shipping; outside US - $35 includes shipping, Publisher - Companion Birds Press T he information about African Grey Parrots shared by the author goes well beyond simple description. She offers clear and relevant direction regarding all aspects of the care and breeding of African Grey Parrots. Her love and respect for these birds is obvious throughout the book.This extensive collection of thoughtprovoking articles on the Grey Parrot species represents the author's years of observation and experience with breeding, and hand-raising Greys. The reader gets the distinct impression that the offering of information represents a sincere educational effort. The book is filled with sound, practical knowledge and deep convictions about the best way to manage African Greys.Geared toward all audiences associated with African Greys, the articles cover a wide range of topics such as The Egg, From One Breeder to Another, Life After Weaning, Bringing Your Baby Home, and The Adolescent Grey. Detailed information is provided on diet, average weights, wing clipping, and managing stress in African Grey Parrots. There is something for everyone in this excellent book and no stone is left unturned.Although the title, For the Love of Gnrys, leads one to conclude that this book is exclusively about African Greys, it is sure to become an important guide and reference for owners of all parrot species. I highly recommend this "must own" book for the novice and expert alike.Author Bobbi Brinker has been breeding and hand-raising exotic parrots for over 10 years. She is well known for her contributions to the education and ongoing support of pet owners and fellow breeders, and her writings are widely distributed nationally and internationally.
