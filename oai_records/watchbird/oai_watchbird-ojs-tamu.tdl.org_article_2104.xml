	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Sir,I would first like to mention how very much I enjoy the Watchbird. Everyone should have the pleasure of seeing such dedication in their field of interest as we in aviculture do, with A.F.A.In the Jan 82 issue I read with great interest Ms. McMullan's article on "going light."Soon after reading the article I was visiting Mrs. Nancy Adams, owner of Adams' Olde World Pet Shoppe here in Lexington, Kentucky. Nancy asked me to take a look at a Meyers parrot in her stock.What I observed was a Meyers parrot so weak and near death most would give up. He could barely sit a perch and was very, very thin. His feathers were fluffed and his eyes dull.Ms. Adams related to me that he ate almost constantly while awake. She said that he had not responded to any medications.Ms. Adams had purchased the Meyers in Dec 81. She had held him for 10 days to allow him to adjust before sale. He was fed a seed mixture of cockatiel and parrot mixes supplemented with some fruit and greens.He was caged in standard parrot cage and displayed in a draft-free glass-fronted enclosure.He had been sick for about 10 days or 2 weeks before I saw him.I suggested that whole kernel corn and Wheat Chex cereal be added to his diet. I also went to a G.M.C. health food store and purchased a bottle of Papaya Digestive Enzyme tablets. These contain papain, prolase, (protein digesting enzymes); amylase (starch digesting enzyme); bromelain, lipase and cellulase. They are distributed by Nutrition Square, Pitts., Pa., 15222. This was given two tablets disolved each morning in 8 ounces of water. Ms. Adams fed the parrot frozen whole kernel corn and Nabisco shredded wheat cereal and the tablets for one week before I saw him again.The Meyers was gaining weight and strength. He was bright eyed and very active after only 7 days.I hope that this will add to your information collection.The results are great and both Ms.Adams and I wish to thank Ms. McMullan for her contribution and the A.F.A. for your publication.Sincerely,Michael DownyI have forwarded your letter to Ms. Mc Mullan and I urge all of you who have any pertinent information to contact her at 931 Harvard Rd., San Mateo, Ca., 94402. </dc:description>
