	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Though most breeders of Exhibition Budgies are less concerned about which color a bird is, so long as it approaches the Ideal for type, size, head qualities and stance, there is no doubt that the wide range of color varieties is an attraction for many, and well may be the reason many persons became introduced to the Fancy.The birds illustrated, a copy of a painting by Eric H. Peake, one of Britain's foremost bird artists, show but five of the mutations which have evolved from the original light green of Australia.Upper left, a Grey Green which along with the Light Green, Dark Green and Olive, comprise the Normal Green Family.Upper right, an Australian Dominant Light Green Pied; these are also bred in the Blue series, and are fast becoming one of the popular exhibition birds, because they can be improved by breeding to a normal variety.Center, a Normal Violet; though difficult to breed up to the exhibition quality of other Blue family members such as the Sky Blue, Cobalt and Grey, a good specimen is greatly admired.Lower left, a Cinnamon Light Green; there is a cinnamon variety of just about all colors, wherein the color markings on wings and head are brown instead of the normal black. This family has good feather quality.Lower right, an Opaline Dark Green; the opaline mutation is also found in most any color, differing from the normal in that the head and the Vee of the back between the wings should be free of markings, which should be confined to the wings. Some specimens carty a suffused opalescent effect which is very beautiful.Â </dc:description>
