	<dc:description xml:lang="en">At long last, restrictions on the interstate sale and shipment of captive bred, non-native, endangered species have been eased. Permits will no longer be required for inter-state commercial transactions conducted for the purpose of propagation.On September 17, 1979, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) published the final rule making in the Federal Register, Vol. 44, No. 181. Under the new rules, buyer and seller must be registered with the Service.Request for registration must be made on official application form (Form 3-200) available from: Wildlife Permit Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C. 20240, and must contain the following information:1) The types of wildlife sought to be covered must be identified by common and scientific name to the taxonomic level of family, genus, and species;2) A description of the applicant's experience in maintaining and propagating the types of wildlife sought to be covered by the registration, or on conducting research directly related to maintaining and propagating such wildlife;3) A description, if appropriate, of the means by which the applicant intends to educate the public about the ecological roll, and conservation needs of the affected species; (ED. NOTE-applies to zoos and institutions only)4) Photograph(s) or other evidence clearly depicting the facilities where such wildlife will be maintained; and5) A copy of the applicant's license or registration, if any, under the animal welfare regulation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Each person registered must maintain accurate records of activities conducted under the registration and submit a writ-· ten annual report to the Director(USFWS).AFA's efforts in obtaining relief have been considerable and are reflected in the numerous times the '' American Federation of Aviculture" name appears in the text of the final rule-making.Although some paper work remains as a burden to the aviculturist, it is a dramatic improvement over the previously unworkable system.AFA suggestions were adopted regarding nearly every issue AFA raised. The only significant issue not resolved was the inclusion of the Nene Goose and Hawaiian Duck on the list of native species to be allowed in inter-state commerce under the new program. Currently, only the Laysan Teal may be sold or shipped between registered breeders.The Nene Goose and the Hawaiian Duck issue remains open for further comment, according to the final rulemaking. AF A will pursue their inclusion, since only the Governor of Hawaii opposed such a move, contrary to our wishes, and the wishes of the Smithsonian Institute and the Service's Acting Endangered Species Coordinator in Hawaii.A list of endangered birds bred in captivity, accompanied by photographs, will appear in a future issue of the Watchbird.For a copy of the complete text of the above rule making, please send $1.00 to AF A to cover costs of reproduction and postage . </dc:description>
