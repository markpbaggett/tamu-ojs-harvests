	<dc:description xml:lang="en">T his is an exciting time to he breeding the Asiatic parakeets. I cannot think of any family of birds that has raised so much interest in the avicultural community as these birds. With all the enthusiasm this is a great time for the Asiatics Breeders Association (ABA). Yet we are the new kid on the blockAfter the AFA convention in Concord, California last year, the expectations began to mount. There was a group of breeders who felt there must be some way to communicate and disseminate information not only amongst ourselves but to the public as a whole. Out of this, the ABA was horn (hatched").It is very interesting to take your birds to a mart and hear comments such as "I have never seen a bird as gorgeous as that. What is it?" or "I don't have the real rare ones hut, in my way of thinking, for pure beauty the lutinos are hard to heat." jack Basriaan, author of Ringnecked Parakeets and Their Mutation-lists over 85 combinations of mutations in the Indian Ring-necked Parakeet. There is one pairing that can theoretically give you 32 different possihilities. just think, if this pair averaged four chicks a year, it would he theoretically possible to hreed the pair for eight years and not produce two chicks alike.The ABA's first issue of its publication featured an exquisite hlue Alexandrine Parakeet-pure hlood, not a hyhrid with the Indian Ringneck. The photo was courtesy of Roger Bringas, an expert in the field of rare mutation psitracines. And, I am told, the cover of the next journal will he just as exquisite and beautiful. </dc:description>
