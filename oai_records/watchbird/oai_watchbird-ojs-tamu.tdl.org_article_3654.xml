	<dc:description xml:lang="en">One Thursday early in September, 2013, I travelled 94 miles from my home in Leesburg, Virginia to Hershey, Pennsylvania to visit zookeeper/naturalist Katie Govern of ZooAmerica. Katie had provided an invitation to witness the banning of this year’s first (parent-raised) Thick-billed parrot chick at three weeks and two days. Head up with big bright eyes - what a healthy-looking baby at 291 grams! That day, I shared in their collective pride over this major accomplishment. The staff had waited two days in order to accommodate my desire to witness this momentous occasion, for which I am very appreciative.At Zoo America there are six adult birds in the flight along with the newly hatched baby in the nest box. One of the adult parrots is the two year old daughter of the breeding pair, who seems to be pairing up with one of the single males. Last year the parents did not breed, apparently due to constantly having to attend to the expressed needs of their female chick, far longer than they may have wished, or would have had to in the wild. All the parrots get along in the flock and appear to act as protectors of the nest box, although the parents do not want other flock members to land on the box or come too close to the sanctity of their home. There are also two feeding stations and another nest box designed to ease any tension that may arise during the breeding season.These particular parrots have been selected among 40+ member institutions in connection with the Species Survival Plan (SSP) of the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) to ensure genetically diverse offspring. This birth announcement will be reported and recorded to the participating SSP zoos. The approximate 30’ x 20’ x 9’ aviary is not high-tech and is simply made of wood and wire, but certainly adequate. Zoo visitors must view the enclosure from below the hillside upon which it is situated. The structure is encompassed by pine trees, adding a sense of security and privacy. The nesting material consists of aspen pine shavings and pine needles, to absorb moisture and prevent spores and mold. The Thick-billed parrots are fed twice a day during the time there are young in the nest and they get fruits and vegetables, commercial feed by Mazuri, and many nut varieties, especially...</dc:description>
