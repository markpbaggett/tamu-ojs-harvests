	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Once the acclimation period iscompleted and it has been determinedthat the new macaw is in goodhealth, the first taming lessons canbegin. The most effective trainermust thoroughly examine his dailyroutine, and plan to give taminglessons on a regular basis when freetime is most available. The decision totame and keep a macaw as a petrequires the owner to devote time tothe task each and every day. After thebasic taming is accomplished, it isimperative for the macaw owner tounderstand that pet macaws needdaily attention (not just daily maintenance)to thrive happily in the humanenvironment. To tame a wild macaw,it is necessary to give at least threeformal lessons per day. Taming can beaccomplished by pet owners whowork full-time, if the lessons areplanned and administered properly.Â Taming your own pet macaw is anexciting and rewarding experience.Should you decide to have a professionaltrainer tame the wild bird, beaware that you will still have to put ina considerable amount of time toproperly socialize your new pet. Therole of the professional trainer cannotsubstitute for the ongoing relationshipbetween a pet macaw and itshuman owner.</dc:description>
