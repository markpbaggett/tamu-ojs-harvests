	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Do you remember hearing the phrase,''free as a bird''? I do. And for years Iassumed it had true significance, that isuntil I really became interested in birdsand wanted to possess some of my own.It was only after constructing cages andsecuring them with locks to keep outthe neighborhood rascals, that I realizedI was a warden and these creatures weremy captives. The lot of them, includingparakeets, finches, doves and canarieswere birds in gilded cages, surrenderingsome of their freedom and much oftheir responsibility to be fed, wateredand put to bed by a human being.</dc:description>
