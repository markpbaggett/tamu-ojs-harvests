	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The American Federation of Aviculture AVY Award Committee presented a First US Breeding Award to Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo during the 36th annual convention in recognition of the successful breeding of the rare Shoebill Stork. The award marks the accomplishment of Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo as the first institution in North America, and the second institution globally, to hatch an African Shoebill Stork chick in captivity.Accepting the award on behalf of Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo-presented during the Saturday evening banquet -were Vice President and Director of Collections Lawrence E. Killmar, Ph.D.; and Animal Care Manager of The Aviary, Julie Tomita. Bird Keepers Kelley Campbell and Marcus Kowitz were acknowledged as part of the team effort.The team worked diligently to observe and document parental feeds, nutrition, health, safety and growth of the chick. The detailed application and accompanying photographs provided by Dr. Killmar were presented to the AVY Award Committee members for investigation and confirmation in order to verify the award.Born Christmas day 2009, the hatchling pipped the shell at approximately 7:30 a.m. and was observed fully emerged, vocal, and alert by the following evening. The first egg, laid Oct. 3, 2009, was produced when Tampa's Lowry Park turned its North Lake into a giant free-Right aviary with other storks, Ramingos, pelicans, cormorants and a group of ring-tailed lemurs on an island. The egg was accidentally crushed, however, a second egg was laid in November that hatched successfully after 42 days of incubation.The zoo maintains two adult pair of Shoebills within its Ituri Forest exhibit. Many of the AFA members who signed up for the behind-the-scenes tour of Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo during the convention Wednesday afternoon were able to observe the Shoebills, including the fully weaned chick that appeared as tall as the parents.The Shoebill Stork, (Balaeniceps rex), is also commonly known as the Shoe-billed Stork, Whaleheaded Stork, or Bog Bird.These darkly colored bluegrey storks Raunt overly large bills that measure upward of 12 inches long, and 5 inches wide, which are reminiscent of the shape of a wooden shoe, hence their name. Adults stand at 3.5 feet to 4 feet high, with a broad wingspan and long straight legs that accentuate their stork-like appearance. The youngster appeared as large as the adults and was fully capable of Right.Â </dc:description>
