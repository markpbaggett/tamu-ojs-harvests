	<dc:description xml:lang="en">IntroductionHistorically lories have been an outstanding feature of the avian collection at the San Diego Zoo. Beginning in 1925 with Swainson's Lorikeets, as many as 28 different species were exhibited at one time during the late 1960s and early 1970s.During this period the lories were housed in a group of 35 enclosures known as Benchley Plaza. For the lory enthusiast, this provided the opportunity to view the obvious differences between such genera as Eos, Lorius, and Chalcopsitta, as well as compare the subtleties between subspecies of Trichoglossus and Eos. Unfortunately, it was not uncommon to exhibit singles or same sex individuals of any particular species; therefore, breeding and maintaining a self-sustaining population was rarely possible.Â In the late 1980s a new emphasis emerged in the zoo community - conservation and the need to establish self-sustaining captive populations. With a limited number of enclosures, this new emphasis had its effect on the Jory collection. The number of different species and subspecies has decreased to allow for more pairs of some of the critical species to be worked with. However, the Jory collection still remains impressive with species that include: Tahitian, Cardinal, Solitary, and Red-flanked Lories.Species Tahitian LoryThe Tahitian Jory, Vini peruoiana, was first received in 1978 as a result of a confiscation. TI1e current captive population is limited to the San Diego Zoo and Laro Parque. Because of its rarity in captive collections, this lory is often thought to be equally rare in the wild. However, it appears to be rather common in its indigenous habitat of the Cook, Society, and westernmost part of the Tuamotu Islands of French Polynesia. Even though 61 chicks have been hatched at the San Diego Zoo, it has been difficult to establish the desired self-sustaining numbers of this Vini. Salmonella, sarcocystis, a variety of bacterial infections and incompatibility have all been challenges.Blue-crowned LoryThe Blue-crowned Lory, Vini australis, from Samoa, Tonga, and the Lau Archipelago, first came into the collection in late 1971. As a result of a combined effort with the Assiniboine Zoo in Canada, we again acquired this species in 1991. As of June 1997, a total of 54 chicks had hatched. Seven were from the original 1971 pair, hatching between 1973 and 1979. Thirty-eight were from the two pairs received in 1991 and the remaining nine from second generation offspring. In February of 1997, six more birds were added to our stock from captive-reared birds from the Assiniboine Zoo.Solitary LoryThe Solitary Lory, Phigys solitarius; from the Fiji islands, is the sole representative of this unique genus. San Diego first exhibited this species in the 1960s and early 1970s. It was not until March 1991 that the Zoological Society again acquired a shipment of 10 Solitary Lories which turned out to be seven males and three females. Since the birds were acquired in conjunction with the Assiniboine Zoo, three males and one female were sent to them for breeding. Presently five pairs have been set up with a total of 23 offspring. Recently a wild-caught male was returned from Assiniboine to provide genetic diversity.Cardinal LoryCertainly one of the most beautiful of the Jory family is the Cardinal Lory, Chalcopsitta cardinalis. This species is from the Solomon Islands and is said to be numerous throughout natural range, however it has never been common in captivity in the United States or Europe. It has been bred in Europe and South Africa, but to our knowledge it has not bred in the U.S. The pair exhibited at the San Diego Zoo was received in 1991 when a small number of these birds were imported into the United States. Even though they have been given a number of different enclosures, the birds have not yet bred.Red-collared LorikeetThe Red-collared Lorikeet, Trichoglossus haematodus rubritorquis, of northern Australia, is certainly one of the most striking of the rainbow group. It was once listed as the most common lory species held in European aviculture, but recent reports indicate that it is now found in only a few collections. It has never been common in the United States. Twenty eight were produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s but were not kept in the collection. In 1988 two pairs were received from the Melbourne Zoo in Australia. Unfortunately, the two females died soon after arrival and it was not until 1995 that we obtained a captive-reared female from Walsrode Bird Park in Germany. Since that pairing, seven young have been produced with offspring returned to Walsrode.Purple-capped LoryThe Purple-capped Lory, Lorius domicellus, from the Indonesian islands of Ceram and Amboina, has always been an uncommon species in captivity. It was first...</dc:description>
