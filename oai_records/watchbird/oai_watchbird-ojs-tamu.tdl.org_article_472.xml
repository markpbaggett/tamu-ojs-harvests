	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The genus Coracopsis contains twospecies, the lesser vasa (C. nigra) andthe greater vasa (C. vasa). They are theleast typical and, perhaps, also theleast admired of all parrots becausethey are entirely dull grey. Only thosewho admire parrots for their personalityor who are intrigued by theirbehaviour will appreciate the vasas.For me, they hold a fascination whichis equalled by a few but not surpassedby any other genus.Vasas were almost unknown in captivityuntil the early 1980s. The lesserhas been bred in captivity in four orfive collections (at Chester Zoo inBritain and in private collections inGermany and Switzerland). I do notknow of any published report of thebreeding of the greater vasa and wouldbe most interested to hear from anyonewho has succeeded.</dc:description>
