	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dear Editor:When two pairs of my smaller Australianparrakeets produced young, I thought thatit might be wise to close-ring them since,what with the turmoil over captive birds,I could foresee being called upon to provemy birds were captive-bred, not smuggled.Accordingly, I ordered rings from an advertiserin the Watchbird who shipped themmost promptly. They were exactly what Ihad in mind, numbered OI through 25,contained my initials and the year.At I2 days of age I slipped rings no. 01through 04 onto the right legs of the broodin one aviary and thought smugly that I hadshort-circuited any potential problems, atleast with this lot.Wrong! On 4/25 at 0930 the first chick,a female wearing ring 03, exited the nest.At 1400 on the same day, a male (01)emerged. Two days later, on 4/27, the third(04) abandoned ship, followed an hourlater by the fourth and last one (02).On 4/30, a Saturday, I noticed that no.04 seemed to have difficulty standing onperches so I caught him up to examine him.He was unable to use his right leg, it hunguselessly, and I resolved to take him to thevet on Monday, which I did.When I caught him up to transport himI saw that his ring was gone and I remarkedupon this to my wife, wondering how thiswas possible.</dc:description>
