	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The American Association of Zoo Keepers (AAZK) recently awarded a Certificate of Merit to Frank Twohy, supervisor of birds at Sea World of San Diego, for his efforts in the marine park's Antarctic penguin project.The certificate is presented each year to the keeper most involved in the project which receives the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums Edward H. Bean award. Considered the Academy Award of the zoological field, Bean awards are given to zoological institutions in recognition of captive management and husbandry of birds, mammals and fishes. Sea World received the award for achievements in the captive propagation of Adelie penguins in 1979. The Sea World project is the only one of its kind established to maintain a selfperpetuating colony of Antarctic penguins available year-round for research.Twohy also received a Certificate of Excellence in Journalism from AAZK. Twohy's article on the hand-rearing of Adelie penguins appeared in the April, 1980, issue of Animal Keepers' Forum, a monthly magazine published for AAZK members. The article detailed the techniques of hand-rearing Adelie penguins through a 12-week period from hatching to fledging.Twohy, with Sea World's aviculture department for six years, has spent two austral summers in the Antarctic, involved in research and collection activities, in addition to his work on the project at Sea World. </dc:description>
