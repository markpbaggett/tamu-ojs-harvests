	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Pyrrhura Breeders Association... An Amazing Organization Doing Amazing Things</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">T he Pyrrhura Breeders Association came about to bring together people interested in the keeping and breeding of Pyrrhura conures, to share information and knowledge on the individual species and subspecies, and to establish studbooks for the rarer species. The Pyrrhura Breeders Association features an on-line based forum and a web-site full of information and pictures of Pyrrhura conures.One can also benefit from their printed quarterly newsletter which features informative articles on species, nutrition, breeding, and other items of interest. It also contains free members-only ads for 'wanted' and 'for sale' birds.If you have ever had questions about Pyrrbura conures and nowhere to get answers, find your answers here. You may also connect with other Pyrrbura breeders and discuss breeding, feeding, housing, and caring for these beautiful creatures. Find out what works for others and what doesn't. Locate mates for your singles or that particular species that you have always wanted.The Pyrrhura BreedersAssociation is growing and now includes members from Europe and South Africa. After turning two years old in January, 2001, all of their programs are holding their own and they have recently published their fourth on-line PEA Newsletter.The PBA will have a booth and meeting at the American Federation of Aviculture convention in Houston and will also hold a raffle.A breeding consortium was started in August 1998 and in November of 1998 papers were filed with US Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service. It took time to get specific species permitted and then to get the individual birds permitted, totaling a little over a year and a half. The actual process began with the shipper · getting health certificates and CITES permits in order to export from his country.In the US, they had to reserve space with a USDA quarantine facility and coordinate the importation with USDA, USF&amp;amp;WS, Customs, customs brokers, and transportation to the quarantine facility.The birds spent the mandatory 30 days in isolation, were tested for Exotic Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza. The birds were released from quarantine on December 5, 2000. By now, the Pyrrhura Breeders Association had been involved in this project a little over two and a half years.Altogether, the five consortium members brought in 12 pairs of Rosefronted Conures Pyrrhura p. roseifrons and 10 pairs of Fiery-shouldered Conures Pyrrhura e. egregia. The birds were distributed in multiple pairings across the United States to the five members of the consortium. They decided that having them in different areas the birds would not be vulnerable to one catastrophe and the species would be easier to establish nationally. Presently, they are compiling information into studbooks for Painted, Souance, and Black-capped Conures. </dc:description>
