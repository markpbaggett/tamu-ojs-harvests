	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Responding to the increased amount of legislative activity within the pet industry in recent months, the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council (PIJAC) has activated an inbound WATS telephone line. The new 800 number will enable PIJAC members, members of state and local pet organizations and hobby dubs, and the media to receive instant updates on the status of legislation or rule-making proceedings in various jurisdictions, according to Richard Peterson, PIJAC President.Legislators, regulators, the media and others are encouraged to use PIJAC through this number as a central clearinghouse on the status of legislative and regulatory procedures and to obtain information on model laws for various aspects of the pet industry.The number, 800 553-PETS, is a direct tie to PIJAC headquarters in Washington, D.C. PIJAC staff will respond to caller requests for information during normal working hours (9 to 5:30 Eastern).Peterson emphasized that information available through the new 800 line encompasses legislative and regulatory activities only. The new communications aid is not meant to supplant the use of regular telephone lines for routine business calls to the organization. • </dc:description>
