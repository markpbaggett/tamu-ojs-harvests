	<dc:description xml:lang="en">IntroductionToucans, those banana billed birds most commonly associated with the television commercials for Fruit Loops breakfast cereal, are unique to the western hemisphere ranging from central Mexico to southern South America. The family Ramphastidae consists of six genera - Aulachorhynchus, Pteroglossus, Selenidera, Baillonius, Andigena, Ramphastos - and forty-one species.Toucans in general have adapted to a widely varying habitat from the coastal rain forests of equatorial Brazil to the high elevation cloud forests of the Andes, spending most of their time in the canopy where they feed, play and pass the day. Toucans are omnivorous feeders consuming a variety of soft fruits, insects, eggs of small birds and an occasional lizard or small rodent.Characteristic of all Ramphastids are their large, flamboyant bills, which probably evolved as a display function during their courtship ritual. These extremely lightweight bills are sturdy enough to serve in the tearing of fruit or flesh, excavating nest cavities, and in jousting with other toucans.DescriptionThe Ariel Toucan (Ramphastos ariel) is predominantly black as are all the species of the genus Ramphastos. The bill is black with a yellow base line approximately one half inch thick extending from the top of the upper mandible to the bottom of the lower mandible. The ridge of the upper mandible is blue-gray. The crown, nape, back, wings, tail, and abdomen are black. The area around the eye is orange and the eye itself is blue. A large bib patch extending from the base of the bill to the abdomen and to the sides of the breast is an orangeyellow bordered in white. At the base of the bib is a one to two inch band of red extending side to side. The rump is red; the legs and feet are blue-black. The bird measures approximately 16 inches in length from crown to tail.RangeThe Ariel Toucan has one of the broadest ranges of all Toucans. It extends from the Tapajoz River in northern Brazil to Minas Gerais in the south and from the coastal areas of Bahia to the foothills of the Andes. It is a tropical species living in the rainforests of the lowlands.Captive EnvironmentA large aviary measuring 24' x 16' x 9' was established as a breeding flight. In each comer of the shelter was placed a five foot long log cut from a fan palm tree. Each log had been hollowed out to a depth of approximately twenty inches using a chain saw. This was accomplished after a section eight to ten inches had been sliced off the upper end to be used as a lid for the nest. A square notch was cut in the side for use as a nest entrance.A large branch from an English Walnut tree was hung in the opposite comer of the flight using bailing wire covered with garden hose. The hose provides visibility to the support wires in order to avoid collision between it and fast flying Toucans. In the shelter a perch of one inch diameter dowel was hung approximately six feet from the ground. There are no other perches in the flight. The flight is not planted except for bermuda grass and occasional weeds.Initially, three birds were placed in the flight by themselves, where they remained nearly two years. During this period no interest was displayed in the nesting logs. This may have been the result of the unsatisfactory condition of the logs, which were wet at the time of acquisition and required more than twelve months to completely dry out. During this "drying out" period the logs emitted an odor of ammonia, which may have been repugnant to the birds.During the course of the first two years a hierarchy developed among the birds. Mild aggression was displayed resulting in the eventual bedraggled appearance of one bird, which was eventually removed. At the same time, two more birds were added. BreedingAfter the odd bird was removed, as mentioned above, it became apparent from behavior and bill size variation, that the two remaining birds were male and female. The two new birds were also male and female and were placed in the flight in November 1977.The four birds appeared to be very compatible until late April to early May 1978. On May I 0th one bird was found hiding behind one of the nest logs. When it was removed to the center of the flight, it was immediately pursued by another bird, whereupon it retreated to the safety of its hiding place. At this point it was removed from the flight.It was now apparent that two birds were pairing off in preparation to nest. Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine which two of the remaining three birds. On May 14th the problem was gruesomely resolved with the death due to injury of the odd bird. At that time the nest log in use was examined and found to have been hollowed out to the ground - a distance of three feet. In the bottom of the nest were clustered three solid white eggs. Subsequent attempts to examine the nest were fruitless, since the hen refused to leave.Finally, on May 26th the hen was coaxed from the nest after the lid was removed and the cavity examined with a flashlight. On her way out the hen managed to soundly jab me with her beak severely enough to draw blood. All three eggs were fertile and hatched May 28th. From the behavior of the birds in early May, it is assumed the eggs were fayed between the 10th and 14th of the month.Five days after the eggs hatched, one baby disappeared and was never found. It was possibly eaten by the parents, or at least carried from the nest and dropped in the high grass. A close watch was maintained on the remaining two nestlings to insure they were cared for properly; if it had appeared the contrary, they would have been removed for handfeeding. Fortunately, the two youngsters progressed nicely without incident and fledged the nest July l4and 19, 1978, respectively.The breeding pair of Anel Toucans with the hen on the left and the male on the nght. A slight difference in the size of the beaks can be seen. </dc:description>
