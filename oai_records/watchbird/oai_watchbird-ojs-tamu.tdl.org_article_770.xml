	<dc:description xml:lang="en">They're Back ... Beware of Bargain BirdsOn 23 February I traveled to Mission, Texas to attend anauction of confiscated birds. The selection being offeredincluded Yellow-naped, Yellow-headed, White-fronted, Redloredand Lilac-crowned Amazon parrots as well as Half-moonand Green Conures. Most birds appeared rather young withsome sporting attractive, dyed yellow heads, an often telltalesign of birds of questionable origin.Despite Texas being within several hundred miles ofMexican parrot populations, species from northeastern Mexicowere in the minority at the auction. Hopefully this is due to theMexican border state of Tamaulipas's recent ban on internalcommerce in their native parrots. The most abundant speciesbeing offered, with 50 or more next door for the next auction,was the Yellow-naped. This bird appears to be sufferingheavily from illegal poaching in Guatemala and Honduras. It iscertainly a species that needs to be bred in larger numbers andlooked out for when the deal seems too good to be true.â€¢</dc:description>
