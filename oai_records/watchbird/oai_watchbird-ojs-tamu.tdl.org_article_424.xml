	<dc:description xml:lang="en">My dear friend , if you have a parlorbird or two you need read no further.This article is not fo r you. If, on theother hand , you are a serious aviculturistwith a modest to respectablecollection of birds, please pay attention.I 'm going to reveal a concepthitherto unknown in the annals ofmodern aviculture.Let me begin by painting a verba lscenario. You awake one morning ,have your coffee, then leisurely ambleout to observe your birds. Your man, ofcourse, has the feeding and watering allclone by the time of your 9:00a.m.stroll. With your stick you point outvarious adjustments and changes you' cllike effected before noon . Suddenly,without warning, you spot a kingparrot a bit fluffed up and lookingpoorly. Instantly the bird is sent off tothe local vet and shortly thereafterword arrives that the bird died fromcauses unknown. The word is accompaniedby a S 120 bill.A week later another bird dies and isposted . Again , inconclusive reports ofdamaged liver, some E. coli , etc. Nowyou're a bit worried. Birds shouldn 'tbe dropping from the perch . The nextbird that looks ill is treated by the vetand returns to the flock after a weekand S490 worth of hospitalization. Ithad a bacterial infection .So far you have two dead birds, oneconvalescing and about S800 investedwithout much return . You still worryabout the total collection of some 200birds. You recoi l at the thought oftaking each bird individually to the vetfor a check up. What to do?</dc:description>
