	<dc:description xml:lang="en">THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF AVICULTURE, INC. (AFA) continues its proud tradition of bestowing top honors to AFA winning members at the two largest bird shows in the USA, the Great American Bird Show (GABS), and the National Cage Bird Show, Inc. (NCBS). The AFA National Show Award, established in 1992, is awarded annually for the Best Bird Bred &amp;amp; Banded by an AFA Member[placing highest overall in each show.AFA Member David Arthur was the winning exhibitor at the Great American Bird Show held November 4, 2006 in Denver, CO, with his exquisite normal green Fisher's love bird. Arthur, a panel judge for the African Love Bird Society (ALBS), also took Best Love Bird and Best Bird in Show with the same bird. AFA Western Regional Director Lisa McManus presented the prestigious award to Mr. Arthur, with AFA Legislative Vice President Sandee L. Molenda announcing the honors. Both ALBS and the Rocky Mountain Society for Aviculture are affiliated member organizations of AFA. AFA Member Julia Allen received the AFA National Show Award at the National Cage Bird Show held November 18, 2006 in Chicago, IL, with a magnificent male normal grey cockatiel. AFA National Show Awards Chair, Linda S. Rubin, presented the coveted award to Mrs. Allen during the banquet. The same entry had received the NCBS Higgins Award for Best Cockatiel in the National Cockatiel Society (NCS) division earlier that evening. The NCS has been an affiliated member organization of AFA since 1984.Both the GABS love bird division, and the NCBS cockatiel division, were presided over by ALBS and NCS Panel Judge Lee Horton. Mr. Horton was a cofounder of the American Federation of Aviculture, Inc. and served as its second president during the years 1976-1978.The first AFA National Show Award was originally presented at the 1992 Great American Bird Show in Metairie, Louisiana, in tribute to AFA Members who reach exceptional standards in exhibiting their birds. In 1996, the AFA voted to reinstate the award and the award was presented nearly each year since to both the Great American Bird Show and the National Cage Bird Shows, in recognition of the two largest national shows in the country.To qualify for the AFA National Show Award, exhibitors must be current AFA members in good standing and fill out an official AFA entry form while registering their birds. A separate form is used for each division in which birds are entered. The exhibitor's breeder code and entries' band numbers that are stamped on the closed, traceable leg bands worn by qualifying birds, is required. At the close of the show, the potential winner's name is verified with the AFA membership database before presentation.For information on exhibiting birds, contact the National Cage Bird Show at www.cncbs.org and the Great American Bird Show at www. greatamericanbirdsshow. org. Additional details on the AFA National Show Award and winner's photographs are published on the website, www.afabirds.org, and in selected issues of AFA In Brief, and the AFA Watchbird.... </dc:description>
