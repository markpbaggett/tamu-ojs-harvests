	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A Bit of HistoryThe Budgerigar was unknownoutside its native land until CaptainJames Cook discovered Australiaduring 1770. It was not until 1794,however, that European naturalistJohn Gould first reported seeinglarge flocks of small green parrotsduring his venture to Austrailia.The grass parakeet was a favoritefood of the Aborigines. In fact, theAborigines call this bird '' Betcherrygah"(good food), hence the name"Budgerigar:' The Budgerigar hasalso been termed with several othernames such as shell parrot, grassparakeet and parakeet.Budgerigars were first imported toEngland during 1840 and soon afterwardswere imported to the UnitedStates. Import dealers imported severalhundred thousands of Budgerigarsuntil 1894 when the Australiangovernment placed a ban on theexportation of these birds.The English Budgerigar vs.The American ParakeetIn many circles there seems to beconfusion regarding the differencebetween the English Budgerigar andthe American Parakeet.The American Parakeet has beenprimarily bred for commercial purposesto meet the demands of the pettrade. As a result, this bird hasremained small in physical appearance( 4'' to 5'' in length) and thefeatures of the bird are unrefined.The colors are randomly mixed forthe purpose of breeding a "heinz"conglomeration of colors on onebird.</dc:description>
