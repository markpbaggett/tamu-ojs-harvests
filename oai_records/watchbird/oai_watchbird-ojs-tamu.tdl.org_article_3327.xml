	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Ferragamo, Concetta</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This edition of the Watchbird features a spotlight on professional aviculturist and world-renowned authority on parrots, Rick Jordan. He is the author of the online courses, AF A's Fundamentals of Aviculture; A Guide to Macaws as Pet and Aviary Birds; Parrot Incubation Procedures; African Parrots (with Jean Pattison); and Parrots: Hand-feeding and Nursery Management (with Howard Voren). He appears in Expert Companion Bird Care Series II, created by avian veterinarians Scott Echols and Brian Speer. He has written more than 150 articles that have been published nationally and internationally. Jordan is a much sought-alter speaker and lecturer. He has bred more than 100 species of birds. Since establishing Hill Country Aviaries in 1996, he has banded more than 10,000 parrot chicks. He is a tireless advocate for avicultural education.By Concetta Ferragamo Dedication to Aviculture as an IndustryIn addition to being the contracted AFA Business Office manager, Rick Jordan volunteers as the AFA CITES Committee chairman, Conservation and Research Committee chairman and sits on the AFA Membership Committee. His devotion to aviculture seems tireless and he often volunteers toassist in the preparation of AF A handouts or legislative mat- Jters and bylaw changes. jJordan wrote the majority of the FOA courses, whichwere made possible by a grant from Pet Care Trust and the Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center, College ofVeterinary Medicine at Texas A&amp;amp;M University. Other authors and contributors of the FOA courses include Barbara Heidenreich, Robin Shewokis,Jason Crean, Dr. Donald Brightsmith,Juan Cornejo,Jeannie Meisle, Lyrae Perry, Matt Schmit, Linda Seger, and more. The Fundamentals of Aviculture (FOA) are online courses that are offered exclusively through AFA and provide veterinarians and vet techs with Continuing Educational Units (CEU's). These educational courses are a great resource and highly recommended for anyone interested in birds, from the novice to the professional. Jordan and team are currently in the planning stages ofFOA III which is expected to be released in 2014.Childhood Memories Ignite Avian InterestJordan's curiosity about avian breeding biology started in his youth. He reminisced about incubating eggs from doves, robins, pigeons and other species that he studied as a youngster. Through constant study of wild birds Jordan was able to witness developmental stages of the embryos-wild birds often discard undesirable eggs from their nesting sites.Jordan said, "I studied and learned about eggs, birds, incubation, and biology. I used to watch with fascination the barn swallows in my grandfather's barn as they built their nests of manure, mud and sometimes the string used to bind the hay bales together."As with most aviculturists, Jordan's parrot passion began with an American Budgie. Jordan said, "I always loved my grandmother's parakeet. At about age 10, my uncle bought me a parakeet and cage set-up and my interest in caged birds probably blossomed from that little 'keet."As Jordan grew up, so did his interest in avian biology. In 1978 Jordan joined the Air force. He secured a bank loan and bought a wild-caught Blue and Gold Macaw (Carlos) as a pet. "My macaw arrived from the jungles with cut wings, a short tail and a ferocious attitude. I was petrified of that bird," he said.He decided to get creative and built a giant jungle gym inthe only spare bedroom of the apartment that he rented. At the time Jordan, was living off-base in Biloxi, Miss. His neighbors used to see him in uniform in the mornings as he headed off to work. They often inquired, "Do you have a pet duck or something. We hear a lot of honking going on from your apartment," Jordan said.Working His Way UpIn 1984,Jordan was discharged from the Air Force and moved to Florida to find a job."Armed with my bachelor's degree from Southern Illinois University, I interviewed for many technical and engineering jobs. Who knew a great grade-point average and no experience would be such a detriment to job placement? As I scoured the want-ads for job openings in the area, I stumbled across an ad from the Avicultural Breeding and Research Center in Loxahatchee, Fla. The ad simply said: 'Come and work on our parrot farm.'"Jordan went on to tell about how he was interviewed and hired as a weekend "crap cleaner" in the aviaries for the Schubot's, He was already working a part-time weekend job for Tom Ireland, a former AFA President and aviculturist in the local area. Between his two aviculture jobs, Jordan quickly learned how to feed aviary birds, clean baby buckets, wipe down counters and prepare soft-foods and vegetables for a large commercial facil-ity. It wasn't long before Dick Schubot realized that Jordan was not content with his position and was called into his office for an interview for a management position.Jordan was honest and told Mr. Schubot that he would seek a job with a future. He knew that Mr. Schubot was "in tight with the McDonald's corporation" and inquired about a referral fora management position with them. Mr. Schubot declined that referral; instead he offered Jordan a management position with his own parrot breeding facility. After accepting the management job at ABRC,Jordan resigned from his job with Tom Ireland and relocated onto the property at the ABRC facility. Jordan's new vocation led to being on call 24/7 which is about the same pace that he leads today. It was from that point on that Jordan started his life career of aviculture full-time which led to his immersion into improving incubation techniques, and his first book on incubating parrot eggs.Â </dc:description>
