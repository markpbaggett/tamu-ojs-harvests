	<dc:description xml:lang="en">It has arrived-the Watchbird library is now available online at www.afawatchbird.com! We have worked since 2009 to collect, scan and upload the complete series of past world-class AFA Watchbirds. This library preserves much of the historyof aviculture since 1974.There are beautiful photographs in every issue! Each arti-cle was scanned with optical character recognition so the text can be translated to other languages. It has search features so you can easily find all the articles on a certain species. You will be able to download whole issues of older journals or individual articles of the more recent journals. Learn about various species and their breeding, conservation, nutrition, behavior and more.We currently are only allowing download of pre-1989 articles, or more recent articles for which we have the author's permission. While authors and photographers grant AFA publishing rights when they submit their articles and images for publication in Watchbird, as an additional courtesy we are attempting to contact them to secure their authorization to allow public download.If you have contributed articles and/or photographs that have been published in Watchbird, or know of anyone who has, please contact the author or photographer and have them contact Mary Ellen LePage at mail@birds2pet.com.Â </dc:description>
