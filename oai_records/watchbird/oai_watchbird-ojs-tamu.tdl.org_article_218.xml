	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dear Sirs:I recently became a member of A.F .A.at the convention in Long Beach. I owna Swainson's Blue Mountain Lorikeetand have been trying to purchase anotherbird but have been unable to do so.Do you have the names and addressesof any breeders of Swainson's BlueMountain Lorkeets?I would appreciate any help you cangive me.Thank you,Mrs. Patrice M. WolferRedding, CaliforniaThe best way to find a mate for yourBlue Mountain Lorikeet is to place awanted ad in the "Watchbird" and otheravicultural journals. Thousands of birdbreeders will know what you want andcan contact you if they have a bird available.You might also contact some of thequarantine stations as a number of !arieshave been imported recently.Swainson 's Blue Mountain Lorikeet(or Lory) is an ambiguous bird. It is alsocalled Rainbow Lory. Under RainbowLory Forshaw lists twenty-one subspeciesall of which are rather similar and willinterbreed. The bird most commonlycalled Swainson 's is Trichoglossus haematodusmoluccanus, but you could actuallyhave one of several others. Good luck inpairing up your Lory.Ed.</dc:description>
