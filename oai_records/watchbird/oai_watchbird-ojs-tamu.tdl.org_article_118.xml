	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Todd, Frank S.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">No reasonable individual can possiblyfault the concept of legislation enactedto preserve endangered species. Quitethe contrary. Professional biologists andnon-professionals alike strongly supportany activity that is genuinely beneficialto wildlife, particularly those in peril.Unfortunately, while the EndangeredSpecies Act of 1973 was well intentioned,it has not turned out to be in the bestinterest of the animals involved. Allresponsible individuals strongly supportthe intent of the Endangered SpeciesAct. However, many are disenchantedwith the final wording, interpretationand ultimate implementation. Eventhough the specific purpose of the Actmay be beneficial and long overdue, bythe time it was worked over and finallypassed, it became a quagmire of confusionand a battery of lawyers were requiredto interpret it. Even today, almosttwo years after it became law, we areunable to obtain straight answers fromWashington regarding certain aspects ofthe Act. If one speaks with three differentindividuals in the same office, onewill inevitably receive three differentanswers.</dc:description>
