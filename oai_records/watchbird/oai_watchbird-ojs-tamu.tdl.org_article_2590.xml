	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dear Editor:What is the difference (besides $15.00) between "individual" membership and "supporting" membership? How about "sustaining" membership? Please advise and thanks for a reply.Cindy Hartman VerduinDear Cindy:Thanks for your inquiry.The different categories of membership correspond to different levels of support a member may wish to give. An "individual" membership is the level of basic membership, which entitles one to receiving the "Watchbird," and to attending AFA conferences at a reduced registration Jee. The dues support AFA activities including publication of the ''Watchbird."A "supporting" membership provides an additional S 15 support to various AFA activities, and the "sustaining" membership an additional $35 support.The primary benefit of higher levels of support is the personal goodfeeling of helping the AFA meet the challenges confronting aviculture and to protect our interests as aviculturists.Editor(J. Jennings)Letter to the Editor:(RE: your editor's note following the article titled "Observations on a Captive Colony of Quaker Parakeets" by Stephen T. Emlen in the Aug/Sept '90 issue of Watchbird)Contrary to your statement, Quaker Parakeets are indeed legal in New York state and may be kept, bred and sold here. In fact, I own a pair myself and occasionally offer close banded babies for sale. The Quaker, or Monk Parakeet as it is also known, is, however, subject to the New York state wild bird law. Only captive bred birds may be offered for sale. I have included a copy of a letter from Pat Martin of the New York State Environmental Conservation Special License Bureau to confirm this information.Sincerely yours,Barbara B. HeckN.Y. State CoordinatorAmerican Federation of Aviculture Dear Jerry:I was delighted to see (page 54, Jan. 1990 Watchbird') that AFA has reaffirmed its policy against hybridization, and will no longer accept ads listing hybrids. Bravo! The irresponsibility of hybridization has long been a burr under my saddle and I am delighted with the AFA action. If it would be of interest, I would be delighted to do an article regarding the evils of hybridizing as well as the possible penalties we may ultimately suffer, if we as aviculturists don't do something to clean up our own act.Sincerely yours, Bob ElgasPast PresidentInternational Wild Waterfowl Association •  </dc:description>
