Zoological Society to the realPrincess Diana, H.R.H . Princess ofWales.Peake often lends his support to U.S .specialty societies. Last year he painteda pair of Spix's Macaws for the Societyof Parrot Breeders and Exhibitors.The Spix's Macaw print was the firstof a series depicting severely enangeredspecies. Proceeds from salesof the prints went to help fundavicultural projects (see ad, Watchbird,June/July '89, page 59).This same concern for the welfareof living species has inspired Peake tohelp AFA's annual convention rafflesand special fund raisers by donatingbeautiful framed prints.Peake will be at the AFA Phoenixconvention this August.
