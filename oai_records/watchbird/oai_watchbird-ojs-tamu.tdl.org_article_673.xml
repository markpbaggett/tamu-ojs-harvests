	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Greater Vasa Parrot Breeding Survey</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">IntroductionThis article presents anecdotal informationon the known successfulbreedings of the special Greater VasaParrot, Coracopsis vasa. My knowledgeof these events is limited andthe numbers too few to consider this adefinitive study of their habits in captivity.I do hope that this informationwill encourage others to experimentwith this unusual species so that wecan preserve the bloodlines nowexisting within North America.Unique CharacteristicsGreater Vasa Parrots are uniquebirds, differing greatly from most otherparrot species. They have long limbs(Silva), unlike any other living species,except for the Lesser Vasa Parrot, Coracopsisnigra. Cloacas extend in bothfemales and males during breedingseason. The skin of both sexes turnsyellow-orange when in breeding condition.The females' beaks grow widerand they also lose their head feathers.Females probably will breed withmore than one male, if available. Theyalso develop a pouch under the lowermandible which fills with a clear fluidwhen feeding young. Their eggs hatchin 17 days and the babies' eyes openin eight days. If conditions are ideal,they will fledge in seven weeks.ProblemsUnfortunately, they are also markedby some not-so-unique problems.Their primary home range, Madagascar,is rapidly being deforested andshortly there will be no place for themto survive. Four or five hundred wereimported into the U.S.A. in 1984/85and, probably, 200 or less are stillalive. Only a few dedicated aviculturistsare interested in these birds. Theyare not very attractive to the eye andthere is little or no commercial marketfor them as pets. Additional importationis unlikely, due to their low desirability,our new federal law and thedifficulty of exporting from Madagascar.Â Limited Timefor SuccessThirty-three babies have hatched inthe USA since 1988, 18 of those fromone pair. The imported adult birdsnow in the USA must all be at leastnine years old or older. While thatmay be old in the wild, one lived incaptivity for 52 years. We should haveat least another five to ten years tolearn how to breed the Greater VasaParrot consistently if we want to savethe bloodlines now residing here. Certainly,all of these imported birds aremature enough to reproduce. Domesticallyraised babies have shownbreeding characteristics at three yearsof age, although none have yet reproducedin the USA.Breeding TableI have compiled a table of breedingsshowing some characteristics of thesuccessful events. While the tablestrongly suggests what we have to do,please remember that I do not haveinformation on all the unsuccessfulbreeding attempts. It is possible thatmost of the Greater Vasa Parrots , successfuland unsuccessful, are set up inmost common breeding conditionsshown in the table. If true, that wouldinvalidate the conclusions I draw fromthe information in the table.Breeding TableAdditionalInformationAll but one pair were fed a generalparrot diet of seeds, fruits and vegetables.One pair was fed a pelleted dietand fruits and vegetables. Nest boxesreportedly ranged in size from a 15" x15" to a 16" x 24" base, with heightsfrom 24" to 36". "Large cage(s)" are atleast 4' x 4' x 8' in size. "Outdoorcage(s)" were either all outdoor orcombined indoor/outdoor cages."Others nearby" refers to other Greator Lesser Vasa Parrots within sight orhearing distance. "Years bred" showsa single year, inclusive years, or firstyear (further success being unknown).</dc:description>
