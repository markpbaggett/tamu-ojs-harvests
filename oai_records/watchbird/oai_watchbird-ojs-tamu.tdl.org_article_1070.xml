	<dc:description xml:lang="en">At last, American Federation of Aviculture's Birdkeeper's Legislative Handbook is available. Introduced at AFA's 1996 convention in Concord, CA, this booklet is the first of its kind to give expert advice to bird keepers. Three years in production, this booklet will prove to be an invaluable resource to the pet owner and bird breeder alike-anyone who has a problem with proposed restrictive laws or who wants to avoid problems with law enforcement agencies and their neighbors.This 32-page booklet tells you in plain English how to ensure that your interests and rights are protected when new laws are proposed or when existing laws are changed. It gives step-bystep instructions on what to do when there is a knock on your door; what to do when you need a lawyer and how to handle many other situations.Kelly Tucker, an AFA Regional Vice President, who donated the prepared manuscript to AFA, believes that "while loss of habitat may be the greatest danger to birds in the wild, adverse legislation and selective enforcement present the greatest danger to birds in our homes." Tucker began getting two to five phone calls a week from desperate bird owners who were frantic for information about how to save their birds.  </dc:description>
