	<dc:title xml:lang="en">The Various Personalities of Amazon Parrots</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Amazon parrots (genus Amazona) are one of the most popular varieties of birds to keep as pets. There is good reason for this popularity. Many species of Amazons make excellent mimics and comical acrobats. They are also quite beautiful.If there is a drawback to owning Amazons, it is probably their loud squawks and aggressive natures. Many birdkeepers stereotype Amazons as talkative, excitable birds that are loud, have unpredictable dispositions and are prone to biting. While there may be some truth to this Amazon stereotype, I believe that such a generalization is unfair to these appealing neotropical parrots. Indeed, the "personalities" of Amazons can vary greatly from species to species. Even individual birds of the same species can be quite different (not surprisingly, hens tend to be less aggressive overall than males).Sometimes it can be very difficult for aviculturists to recognize the subtle differences between the Amazon species. For many aviculturists - unlike pet owners - the relationship they have with their Amazons is feeding and cleaning, and very little more. A long row of green parrots is what they are used to seeing in their aviaries, and attention to each individual bird is impossible (not only impossible, but undesirable, since breeder birds like to be left to themselves). I know that I have come to know my pet birds (many of them Amazons) on a "personal" level far better than my breeder birds that live in flight cages. Thus, the experiences of individual pet owners can be quite interesting. These people can share insights into bird behavior that many aviculturists cannot. During several years of working in various editorial positions at Bird Talk and Bird Breeder magazines, I have conducted a few different surveys on Amazon parrots. These few surveys generated literally thousands of responses from Amazon owners, who described their birds and shared photographs. While reading through all of these Amazon letters has been tedious (and sometimes boring) as well as fascinating, I also have learned a great deal. As far as I know, these Bird Talk surveys have generated more feedback from Amazon owners than has occurred ever before. As a true lover of these birds, I have kept several boxes of these survey responses. They are just too interesting to throw away!In the following paragraphs I will discuss general characteristics of several Amazon species. These species descriptions come from personal observation as well as feedback from the readers of our avicultural magazines.The most popular and numerous Amazons in captivity are Blue-fronted Amazona aestiva, Double-yellowheaded A. ocbrocepbala ssp. and Yellownaped A. o. auropalliata, respectively. Not surprisingly, these birds are also among the most talkative and personable.The Blue-fronted was imported in huge numbers until recent years, which is why these birds are found in such large numbers in the United States. They are also a fairly prolific Amazon in captivity, and captive-bred chicks are becoming more and more available. Of the three most popular Amazon species, the Blue-fronted remains the most gentle. It is also quieter than the Yellownaped or Double Yellow-headed (although if you live with one you might find this hard to believe!). The talking voice of Blue-fronteds does not have the volume of that of the Yellownaped or Double Yellow-headeds.Double Yellow-headeds were not imported legally for many years prior to the Wild Bird Conservation Act, yet there are many birds in captivity - either smuggled or captive-bred. This is probably the most recognizable of the Amazons and, arguably, one of the most attractive. For some reason, I hear of more Double Yellow-headeds that can sing than any other Amazon species. Opera is a big hit among these parrots. I believe this is because the high trilling sound created by this species as part of its natural vocabulary can easily convert to song. A Double Yellow-headed that I owned would typically trill very high and long and then gradually switch this over into opera singing. It is the responsibility of Double Yellow-headed owners to recognize the similarity between the natural Double Yellowheaded voice and human singing, and develop that part of their birds' vocabularies. Apparently many Double Yellowheaded owners have done just that; our surveys reveal that three times as many Double Yellow-headeds can sing than all other Amazon species combined.The Yellow-naped rules supreme in the talking department. There has always been a great deal of debate as to which species talks the best and, like everyone, I have my own opinion. Fortunately for me, my own personal opinion was reinforced by hundreds of letters from Yellow-naped owners. I received lists of hundreds of words spoken by individual talented Yellownapeds. I have never heard of a handfed, pet Yellow-naped over the age of two years that does not talk. This is more than I can say for any other Amazon species. Along with this splendid talking ability is the tendency toward being an unpredictable biter. I have always thought that talking ability among Amazon species and aggressive biting go hand in hand - good talkers are often nippy-yet Yellow-napeds remain one of my favorites. In the home of owners who establish rules and are not intimidated by these birds, the Yellow-naped makes a fantastic pet. I have a male Yellow-naped who is 12 years old, and he remains a very tame pet. Many owners whose Yellow-napeds develop aggressive behavior problems have benefited from the advice of a bird behaviorist. This is not a bird for everyone, but those of us who love them wouldn't part with them for anything.Moving away from the "most popular" Amazons is a mixed group of very appealing parrots. Included here is the Red-lored A. autumnalis ssp., Mexican Red-headed A. uiridigenalis, Lilaccrowned A.finschi ssp., White-fronted A. albifrons ssp., Mealy A.farinosa ssp. and Orange-winged A. amazonica ssp.The Red-lored was another very popular import up until the time importation ceased. These birds are known for their gentle nature, but talking ability for a typical Red-lored is only average. The nominate race, A. autumnalis autumnalis is the bird owned by most parrot fanciers, but I have received correspondence from owners of Salvin's A. a. salvini and Lilacines A. a. lilacina, as well.  </dc:description>
