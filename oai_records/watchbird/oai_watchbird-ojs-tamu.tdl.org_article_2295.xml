	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Psittacosis, biotechnology, finch health and much more, discussed by national authorities at an outstanding modern lakeside location in June 1985, will provide unique opportunities for veterinary practitioners, diagnosticians and researchers to share many items of common concern. Held in the New City of Columbia, Maryland, the meeting will be steps away from excellent restaurants, recreational facilities and free parking. The Baltimore-Washington International Airport is a convenient 30 minute (S7) limousine ride away. Many attractions in Baltimore and Washington, D. C. are similarly-within close driving distance.Prominent speakers will focus on psittacosis, emphasizing information of practical and immediate importance to both practitioners and laboratory workers, during a Chlamydiosis Symposium currently set for Tuesday, June 18.Sessions dealing with advances in rapid avian diagnostic biotechnology (ELISA) are being planned for Monday orTuesday,June 17 or 18inconjunction with solicited scientific papers and case reports. Expert presentations on finch and waterfowl diseases are presently scheduled for Wednesday morning, June 19.A bus trip will be available on Monday evening for those interested in visiting Baltimore's exciting Inner Harbor where opportunities for good fellowship, browsing and seafood and gourmet dining will abound.Hosted by the Virginia-Maryland Regional Col l e g e of Veterinary Medicine, the conference is jointly sponsored by two prominent regional groups: the Pennsylvania Association of Avian Veterinarians, organizers of the popular annual Mid-Atlantic Avian Medicine Seminar for Veterinarians; and the Northeastern Conference on Avian Diseases, now in its 57th year of serving poultry and avian veterinarians and scientists in the Northeastern U.S. and Eastern Canadian Provinces.Featured in recent magazine articles, Columbia, Maryland is considered a model of planned city development. Its stimulating residential and business areas blend with open woodlands, walking paths and ample recreational facilities.Contact person for the combined conference is Dr. E.T.
