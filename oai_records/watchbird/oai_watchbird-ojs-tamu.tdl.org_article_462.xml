	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Man has held an appreciation ofbirds for thousands of years, marvelingat their capability of flight. He hasenjoyed their seranades of sonoroussongs and has been enraptured bytheir often riotous colors. Man 'sappreciation has been as of a work ofart - each species representing a differentexpression of the devine creation.And, how many representativeexpressions there are. Over 8 ,650 differentliving species.While some enjoy the trek throughthe field , and others a trip to the zoo,the aviculturist by definition seeks a" hands-on" involvement. He wantsto sense with more than the eye andear. To feel , if not with the hand, atleast deep down inside that he is apart of the process of the life of birds.To really know what it is that is abird , one must become a biologist,though not necessarily a universitytrained biologist - just someonewho has gone beyond the "artisticappreciation " stage. One doesn'tneed to know the technology ofpainting to appreciate the Mona Lisa,unless one wants to paint the MonaLisa. Thus, to work with birds, onemust understand the technical componentscomprising the subject.</dc:description>
