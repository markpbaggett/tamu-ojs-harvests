	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The term "bird of prey" is used in reference to several types of carnivorous birds - specifically eagles, hawks, falcons, and owls. Although these birds share similar characteristics, such as talons, hooked beaks, and keen vision, not all of them are as closely related as they may appear."Bird of prey" is a rather casual description of members of two unrelated orders of birds; the Falconiformes (eagles, hawks, and falcons) and the Strigiformes (owls). These two groups are an example of convergent evolution, in which two lineages of unrelated birds have evolved similar characteristics and behaviors. Although many different species of birds are predators, "bird of prey" is usually only descriptive of the two above mentioned orders.Each of these orders of birds is subdivided into families, of which each member shares even more distinguishing characteristics. Falconiformes is comprised of five families; 1 ) eagles, hawks, kites, and Old World vultures, 2) New World vultures, 3) osprey, 4) falcons and caracaras, and 5) secretary bird. Strigiformes is divided into only two families; I ) barn owls and 2) typical owls.The Oklahoma City Zoological Park maintains a diverse collection of birds of prey. Most of the above mentioned families are represented in the zoo's bird collection. Not only is the selection of bird families varied, hut the range of size of the birds themselves is great. At the Oklahoma City Zoological Park, visitors can see not only some of the largest birds of prey, but also some of the smallest. Several species exhibited are rarely seen in zoological collections. Others are endangered species in need of captive breeding programs in order to prevent their extinction.Andean Condor Vultur grypbusThe Andean Condor is the largest living species of bird of prey. The wingspan of these immense vultures can reach over three meters (about 10 feet). Males are distinguished from the females by having a large fleshy crest on the beak. Males are also larger than the females, a trait that is unusual with birds of prey. These birds occur in the Andes Mountains of South America.The pair at the Oklahoma City Zoological Park has been exhibited since 1960, and have produced six chicks that survived to adulthood. Andean Condors have a slow reproductive rate, laying only one egg every other year. The most recent offspring parented by these birds have been placed in release programs. Captivehatch Andean Condors have been reintroduced into their natural habitat so researchers could study how well they acclimated from captivity to a natural environment. Andean Condors were also released in remote regions of California. These studies were conducted in order to establish a safe and effective method of reintroducing the highly endangered California Condor Gymnogyps califomianus into its natural habitat.King Vulture Sarcoramphus papaThe King Vulture is one of the most colorful birds of prey. The plumage is black and white, and the head, although featherless, is a brightly colored orange with shades of yellow, red and purple. These vultures also have a brightly colored caruncle at the base of the beak.This is one of only a handful of bird species that has a strong sense of smell. The King Vulture is found primarily in tropical forests of Central and South America, and uses its keen olfactory senses to find carrion that would normally be hidden by dense vegetation.The King Vultures at the Oklahoma City Zoological Park are not only colorful in appearance, but also in per-sonality. One particular mischievous bird, "King Tut," will rarely pass up the chance to give a little love bite to any unwary bird keeper.Bald Eagle Haliaeetus leucocepbalusThe Bald Eagle is perhaps the most recognizable bird of prey, as it is the national symbol of the United States. Despite being the national symbol of the USA, the Bald Eagle became endangered throughout parts of its range. Pesticide contamination in the food chain led to the decline of the Bald Eagle in southern Canada and the contiguous 48 states. After the pesticide DDT was banned in the 1970s, the Bald Eagle's population has been recovering. Although the Bald Eagle's population is on the rebound, it is still classified as a threatened species and remains protected.The Bald Eagle is often thought of as a noble and majestic predator, but often behaves much like an over-sized sea gull, in that it will readily steal food from other birds, scavenge for dead fish in shallow rivers or even dine on roadkill.The Bald Eagle at the Oklahoma City Zoological Park is on loan from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. All captive Bald Eagles are the property of the U.S. government as it is illegal to own one. Like many Bald Eagles in captivity, this bird suffered injuries that would not allow it to survive in the wild.Harpy Eagle Harpia barpyjaThe Harpy Eagle is the largest of the eagles, weighing up to nine kilograms 09.89 pounds). The wingspan can reach two meters, however, these eagles have relatively short wingspans in relation to their body size. The Harpy Eagle is characterized by having a crest of long dark plumes on its head, giving it an owl-like appearance. The size difference between males and females is great. Females are almost twice as large as males.   </dc:description>
