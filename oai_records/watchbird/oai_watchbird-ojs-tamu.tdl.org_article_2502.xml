	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Ex Libris - The Parrots of Luquillo: Natural History &amp; Conservation of the Puerto Rican Parrot</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Clinton-Eitniear, Jack</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Certainly when one thinks of tropical climes, images of toucans, bright flowers and parrots screaming through the green foliage come to mind. Despite such visions, parrots seem to have been neglected, for the most part, by tropical naturalists/ ornithologists. The life cycles of most common species have yet to be documented in the wild and certainly the complex ecology of the rarer species remains to be studied. With new species of psittacines yet to be discovered, and described populations heading for what may well be certain extinction, this book makes a most welcome entrance. Until "The Parrots of Luquillo" publication, no definitive study existed on a single species of New World psittacine.While the orientation of the book is academic, the information included is digestable to the lay reader and of tremendous value to the aviculturist. A substantial portion of the book is devoted to the species' diet, a topic that should interest all owners of Amazon parrots. Finally, we have some sound scientific data as to the wild diets of Amazon parrots! Of equal importance is the significant portion of the book that deals with the species' reproductive biology. Details are given on every aspect including choice of nest sites, spacing of nests, reusing of nests and nest hole orientation. Details are given as to pair formation, egg-laying, incubation and chick rearing.With increasing concern about the future survival of parrots, this literary contribution is of unequalled value as no other parrot program has been so long lasting and detailed. Certainly this is to become one of the classic studies referred to for years to come by researchers, conservationists and aviculturists. Hard bound, the book contains numerous color and black and white illustrations and photographs. Despite what appears to be a well written and produced book (the binding of my copy has survived numerous page bending efforts as needed to photocopy excerpts for colleagues), its price does not reflect its worth. It is obtainable from the publisher (Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology, Suite 1411, 1100 Glendon Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90024) for a meager $31.00 (plus 6. 5 % sales tax if you reside in California)."The Parrots of Luquillo" received financial support from the World Wildlife Fund, The International Council for Bird Preservation, the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Any profits from the sales go to the Puerto Rican Parrot project. "The Parrots of Luquillo" by Noel Snyder, James Wiley and Cameron Kepler, should be on the library shelf of all aviculturists with an interest in New World parrots and/or conservation. If you own an Amazon parrot, you '11 likely be unable to put the book down. Get your copy now as it's bound to be of limited availability in years to come. • </dc:description>
