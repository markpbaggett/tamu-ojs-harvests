	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The West African Crowned Crane(Balearica pavonina) is one ofAfrica's most photographed birds. It isa large bird standing nearly four feettall. Their height, of course, comesfrom their long legs and long neck buttheir exotic look is due to their unusualhead dress. When our youngCrowned Cranes first arrived, ouryoungest daughter called them birdswith the tumbleweeds on their heads.I think the crown feathers look morelike a dandelion puff but tumbleweedor dandelion, they are eye catching.The head has a large white cheekpatch which is soft skin, not feathered.An orange-tipped black wattle is conspicuousunder the lower beak andbecomes somewhat inflated when thebirds vocalize. With an orange spotabove the white cheek patch and witha velvet soft black patch on the frontof their head, it is easy to understandwhy these colorful birds are so oftenphotographed.Crowned Cranes spend most of theirtime on the ground grazing on grassesand hunting small mammals, reptiles and insects.Young Crowned Cranes look quitedifferent from the adults. They arelight brown with white spots all overtheir bodies and the dandelion crownfeathers are much smaller. At the firstmolt they change to the adult color ofpowder gray with black, white andbrown wings. Although the youngstersresemble adults, they do notmature until their fourth year andoften do not breed until their tenthyear. In captivity some never breed.Before our cranes arrived I talked toas many people as possible aboutflight size and breeding requirementsfor these large birds. Pens a 100 feetlong and 50 feet wide were recommendedbut we had to settle for a pen45 feet long by 30 feet wide. When thebirds casually hopped over the sevenfoot fence we covered the top of thewhole pen.Our breeding plan was to move thecranes into a larger flight during theirsixth year. This, we surmised, wouldgive them time to mature. Imagine mysurprise when they laid in their fourthyear. My first clue was when the malestopped me at the door to the flightand would not let me take anotherstep inward. Our nice, tame CrownedCranes became the most aggressivebirds imaginable.Next there appeared a light blue eggthat was in their food tray and broken.WOW! Even though the egg was broken,at least we were on the right trackalthough ahead of schedule. AsCrowned Crane clutches usually containthree eggs, I was hopeful theywould lay another egg or two.My wife suggested that the egg wasbroken because the birds did not havea proper nest. I was told that thecranes prefer a nest of sticks and grassso I gave them a large amount of hay.They dragged the hay all over theflight but didn't make a nest of it. ThenI made a circle of wire three feet talland filled it with sticks and hay. Thisworked because the wire wall keptthe nest together.Three days after the first egg waslaid a second one was deposited inthe new nest. Worried that it alsomight be broken, I considered takingthe egg for incubation. Once again themale Crowned Crane changed myplans. He allowed no one to enter theflight. OK - plan B - fine - you'reon your own! Three days later thethird egg was laid. Nothing changedplanB was still in effect.It was most interesting to watch theparents go about the business ofbrooding their eggs. Both male andfemale incubate them. During the hotsummer days one or both birds wouldspread their wings to shade the eggs.On June 5th 1992, about 29 days afterthe first egg was laid, out hatched abouncing baby crane. The next egghatched shortly after.At this time we didn't know if theparents took food to the young orwhat. I did know that baby cranes liketo eat meal worms so we added theworms to the regular diet of chickenlay pellets, dog kibble, pigeon grainsand game bird flight conditioner.About 18 hours after the eggs hatched,the hen answered my question aboutfeeding by walking off the nest followedby both babies. They followedlike chicks do a mother hen andpecked at everything in the flight.Since this flight was not intended foryoung cranes, there were many hazardsthat could be dangerous to babybirds. The babies would walk fromone hazard to another much to thevocal concern of the parents. Clearlythe young cranes would not survive inthis flight so I decided to catch themfor hand raising. My wife refused toface the aggressive male so I served asa distraction. Actually, it was easierthan we thought. We just waited nearthe gate and scooped up the babies asthey walked by.We took the babies in and made agreat effort to raise them althoughcranes are very difficult to hand feed.The parents are constantly encouragingthem to feed, showing them a varietyof things to feed on. Sadly, wewere not able to keep the babies interestedin eating and we lost them both.One nice thing about birds is thatthey pass no judgement on their keepersand they do not hold a gmdge forlong. We will be better prepared thiscoming breeding season. </dc:description>
