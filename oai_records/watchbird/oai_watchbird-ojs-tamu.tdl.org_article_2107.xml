	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This association was formed over a year ago by Hank Brawley, Dallas, Texas, to aid and abet all those aviculturists interested in the Pionus genus of parrots.The purpose of the organization is to exchange information through correspondence within the membership and to provide a way to pairup odd birds. We also hope, through strength of numbers, to influence various importers and perhaps gain their cooperation in import ing more Pion us.The association at present has fifty members, belonging to whom can be found 257 individual birds in the Pionus genus and representing seven of the nine species. Of this number of birds there are 75 mated pairs. The remaining birds are not paired up for various reasons that the association would like to correct over the next few years.One can join the Pionus Breeders Association for a mere five dollars per year. This modest membership fee also gets you a monthly newsletter wherein much Pionus lore is exchanged. For the novice there is a twelve page booklet available for five dollars that covers selecting stock, housing, the nesting process, and other aspects of Pion us breeding.To join the group send five dollars toHank Brawley,330 Classen Drive,Dallas, Texas 75218.Â </dc:description>
