	<dc:description xml:lang="en">DOROTHEA PETRULAMrs. Dorothea Petrula, a native Californian, has long been interested in birds and photography. She has raised finches and lovebirds for many years and was involved in a family-owned photo-processing business. The event that got her out of the photo-lab and behind the camera was a trip to Africa.Once she started with the camera, Mrs. Petrula continued and constantly improved her technique and tried new and varying ideas. Coupled with her flair for photography is a reverent love for animals of all kinds - but especially birds.At the suggestion of Dale Thompson (formerly at the L.A. Zoo) Mrs. Petrula repaired and restored an old "bird box" - a device into which birds are placed to get good photos of them. The lovebird photos in this edition are examples of what Lee Horton's birds look like in the bird box.Mrs. Petrula's other interests include gardening, jewelry making, and oil painting. She also works with the Los Angeles Zoo Association.Without doubt, Mrs. Petrula will prove a most valuable addition to the Watchbird staff of photographers. JOHN CHELLMANJohn Chellrnan, 29 years old and unmarried, is a professional free-lance photographer who now resides in Los Angeles. He attended UCLA and took a Bachelors degree in meteorology and, of course, the knowledge of lenses and filters gained in his studies has been very helpful in his photography.Mr. Chellrnan has skillfully blended his hobbies with his profession to the enhancement of both - a very neat trick. His hobbies include hang-gliding, mountain climbing, back packing, and crosscountry skiing and snowshoeing. While out in the wilderness John takes beautiful scenic pictures and pictures of little seen wildlife. He specializes in photos of wilderness scenes, mammals, birds, insects and sports.The lovebird photos in this edition were produced by the combined efforts of Mr. Chellrnan and Mrs. Petrula. Lee Horton's lovebirds did not cooperate. Mr. Chellman is currently developing a collection of slides of exotic birds.The Watchbird is fortunate to have Mr.Chellman join its staff of photographers. </dc:description>
