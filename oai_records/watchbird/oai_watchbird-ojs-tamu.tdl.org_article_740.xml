	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Puerto Rican parrot Amazonavittata is one of the most criticallyendangered birds in the world. Historically,the Puerto Ric~n parrot wasabundant, probably numbering in themillions throughout the island ofPuerto Rico and its satellite islands.The parrots were found in most of themajor habitat types on the island; fromthe moist coastal forest to the montanerainforest in the northeast, to the moistlimestone and coastal forests of thenorthwest, and throughout the forestedcentral Cordillera. The low montanehabitats originally covered about35% of the island and it was probablythe major habitat of the parrot.By the early twentieth century, thePuerto Rican parrot disappeared fromall satellite islands, and the mainlandpopulation became fragmented. By1937, only a single isolated populationwas left, and they were confined tothe rainforest of the Luquillo Mountains.1 Surviving Puerto Rican parrotsmay still be found only there.In addition to historical factors thatled to the decline of the Puerto Ricanparrot, problems continued throughthe early and mid-1900s.1 The isolatedLuquillo population of Puerto Ricanparrots became even more vulnerableto storms and hurricanes because allmajor weather systems come throughthe northeast region of the island. Thispopulation also became vulnerable toearly forest management policies thatled to increased accessibility ofremote areas. It is not uncommon forPuerto Rican parrots to engage invicious, even deadly territorial combatsover the defense of nest sites,and, during World War II, many treesof the species preferred by the parrotsfor nests (Cyrilla racemiflora) wereselectively cut, not only to provide asource of energy in the form of charcoal,but to create jobs. This practiceresulted in a scarcity of optimal nest sites. The parrots also contend withnatural enemies such as honeybees(Apis mellifera) that take over nestcavities, and minor predators such asthe Puerto Rican boa (Epicrates inoratus)and rats (Rattus rattus) that arecapable of entering parrot nests anddestroying eggs. The major predatorof the Puerto Rican parrot appears tobe the Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis)which probably accounts forthe majority of parrot mortality. Theaverage annual mortality rate is highamong first year parrots, approximately32%, and declines to approximately90/o for adult parrots.Two other significant problems havebeen with the Warble Fly (Phi/ornispici) that parasitizes parrot nestlings,sometimes causing death, and with anecological competitor, the Pearly-eyedThrasher (Margarops fuscatus). Thethrashers are also cavity nesters andcompete with the parrots for nestsites. Because the thrashers are relativelyrecent invaders of Puerto Rico, ithas been speculated that the parrotshave not yet evolved adequatedefense mechanisms against thethrashers' aggressive and predaciousbehavior.These factors combined, plus thedelayed sexual maturity of the PuertoRican parrot to four or five years ofage, have resulted in considerablereproductive failures: 74% to 88% ofall nests prior to 1973.2 The annualrate of population decline becamespectacular: it escalated from approximately8% in the 1950s to over 41% inthe mid-1960s, before dropping to13% by 1971.1 Population declinesfinally leveled off during the 1970s,but not without severe consequences.The number of Puerto Rican parrotsdecreased by two orders of magnitude:from an estimated 2,000 in 1937to approximately 200 in 1953/54 to aminimum of 13 in 1975.2 The parrotpopulation has remained relativelystable over the last decade, and muchof this stability is due to labor intensivemanagement of the parrot by federaland commonwealth biologistsand other dedicated personnel andvolunteers.Conservation of thePuerto Rican ParrotManagement of the wild populationof Puerto Rican parrots has includedseveral actions aimed at improvingnesting success. Most of these actionsinvolved enhancing natural nest cavities,providing alternative artificial nestcavities for both Puerto Rican parrotsand Pearly-eyed Thrashers, and maintenanceof nests to prevent waterleaks, and honeybee takeovers.1·2Also, intense watches (from sun up tosun down, from approximately Februaryto June) of all known active nestsare conducted from nearby blinds inthe forest.3 Not only are behavioralobservations made on the parrotsfrom the blinds, but interventions aremade on behalf of the parrot to safeguardnests from total failure. In somecases, wet or unattended eggs arebrought to a nearby aviary for artificialincubation, or sick or uncared-for nestlingsare brought in for medical attention.Once hatched or recuperated,nestlings might be returned to theiroriginal nest. Sometimes nestlings areexchanged between nests to ensurethat otherwise failing nests wouldfledge at least one or more young. Asa result, broods of genetically unrelatednestlings are sometimes mixedin a single nest, and genetically relatednestlings fledge from different nests.After about 14 years (since 1973),nest success increased from a minimumof approximately 11% toapproximately 68%,2 but the numberof annual breeding pairs of parrotsand the annual population growth rateremained low. Only two to five pairsof Puerto Rican parrots produced anaverage of 1.6 young per year. 2 Priorto Hurricane Hugo in 1988, there wereabout 45 to 47 Puerto Rican parrots inthe wild: after Hurricane Hugo therewere approximately 24. Today thenumber of Puerto Rican parrots in thewild is still less than 30.</dc:description>
