	<dc:description xml:lang="en">AFA Participates in AAV Conference in Seattle Julie Corwin, AFA Northwestern Regional director, attended the AAV conference in Seattle with a display table for American Federation of Aviculture. It was a great opportunity to speak with the veterinarians, vet-techs and many others who were participating in the conference. Having a bowl of candy at the table definitely encouraged people to stop by and visit.This year the AAV conference included all veterinarians-avian, reptile and mammal-so it was a great opportunity to reach a large audience who might be involved with birds. The AFA table was located in the mainlobby near the entrance of the vendor hall-what a great location!The focus for participating in the event was to explain all the opportunities available within AF A and encourage veterinarians and their staff about the Fundamentals of Aviculture Courses and their benefit.Information was available regarding the courses and the advantage of becoming a Commercial Veterinarian Member affiliated with AFA, and explaining how the Disaster Relief Program works as well.One of the points mentioned was how AFA can actually be a great referral system for them with the clubs, club delegates, state coordinators and regional directors, as well as the other commercial members.We also had merchandise for sale from the AFA store.Coffee mugs, neckties and CITES Pins were popular as gifts and small enough to take home with no extra effort.I had a lot of fun doing this and it was a great opportunity for me to meet in person the names associated in the research and health care field for animals. </dc:description>
