	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The recently formed conservation committee of the American Federation of Aviculture is in need of funds to initiare a variety of projects which were proposed at the Annual Conference in Washington, D.C., last August. The multi-faceted approach to the organization's over-all conservation endeavors includes projects such as AFA-initiated field studies (the first, currently under way on the Red-headed Amazon, Amazona virzdigenalis); public education programs; stipends to existing captive breeding programs for certain endangered species; contributions to field studies initiated by others; and support of proposed land acquisitions for habitat preservation. All of this sounds good' All of these measures are positive' All of these efforts can enhance the total conservation effort on a global scale' The major problem is-none of these proposals can be effectively implemented without adequate funding!As chairman of the Conservation Committee I am appealing to avicultur- ists to assist us in this endeavor by doing what they do best-RAISE BIRDS' My appeal is for each person who raise birds, who appreciates these interesting and beautiful creatures, who has reaped joy and pleasure from keeping them in captivity, to maintain and breed a pair of. birds in their collections on behalf of the AFA conservation committee and donate the wholesale value from the sale of the young from this pair to the conservation fund.Even though we suggest a semidomesticated species such as cockariels, lovebirds, canaries, golden pheasants, diamond doves, mandarin ducks, zebra finches or budgies, it makes no difference which species you select to breed, what color or what kind. As an example of the potential impact of such a cooperative project, if one hundred aviculrurists each maintained a single pair of normal cockatiels on behalf of the committee, and each of these pairs averaged producing eight young in a year and these were sold at a hypothetical wholesale price of $15.00 each, there would be a total income of $12,000 for our conservation programs. Furthermore, if the participants elected ro sell these birds at a higher retail price, they could easily recover their cost of acquiring, keeping and maintaining the birds plus the enjoyment of having them rear young and the additional reward of knowing that they as individuals were in a small way participaring in the cause of avian conservancn.What a wealth of positive public relations potential also exists in this concept. Please consider lending your assistance ro this project. We need your involvement ro make it work. Notify the AF A office and pledge your support.Receipt for each donation will be provided for those who may wish to declare a tax deducrion. </dc:description>
