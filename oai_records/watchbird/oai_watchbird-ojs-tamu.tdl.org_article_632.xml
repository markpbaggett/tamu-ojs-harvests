	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Wheatbelt hybrid is a naturallyoccurring hybrid of the Port LincolnParrot (Barnardius z. zonarius) andthe Twenty-eight Parrot (Barnardiuszonerius semitorquatus). The birdsof this population inhabit an area inAustralia generally farmed for wheat,hence the name, Wheat belt hybrid.These birds, sometimes, are noteasily identified as their plumage canvary slightly or greatly from either ofthe above subspecies.DescriptionThe head is slaty-black in colorwith bluish cheek patches. Generallythere is a red frontal band (i.e., redfeathering above the cere). This bandcan vary greatly from being absent tobeing very prominent. There is a yellowband across the back of the neck.The back is fairly dark green. Theflight feathers are blue, the rump isgreenish blue and the tail feathers aregreen in the center and green, mergingto blue in the outer feathers . Thevent is yellowish green. The chest isgenerally green, but can be interspersedwith yellow feathers orpatches of yellow. The abdomen variesin color from true semitorquatusgreen to z onarius yellow, but mostof the time it is a mixture of bothcolors.Some young birds have a wingstripe. This stripe is a light, almosttransparent portion of the flightfeathers about three to four incheswide. This can be seen when thewing is outstretched or when thebirds are in flight.The cock bird is a larger, morerobust bird than the hen with a largerupper mandible and a larger, flatterhead. The h ead shape on a h en ismore rounded and the upper mandibleis smaller as with the Platycerus(rosella) group. The overall colorationof the hen is not as brilliant.The size of the Wheatbelt hybrid isintermediate between both subspecies.These birds fall within thelengths of 15.5 inches for the PortLincoln Parrot to 16.2 inches for theTwenty-eight Parrot. Their weightcan range from 170 to 200 grams.Their flight usually consists of a seriesof rapid wing beats and a glidevery similar to those of the largerrosellas. They rise directly from theground to a perch or tree limb andalight rosella fashion , fanning theirtail before alighting.</dc:description>
