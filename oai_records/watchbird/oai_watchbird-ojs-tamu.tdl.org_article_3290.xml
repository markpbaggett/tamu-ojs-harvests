	<dc:description xml:lang="en">What hat do you wear best? Have you ever thought about the different hats you wear in life? I have a variety of hats on my hat rack. There is one for the family; one for the birds; one for the dogs; one for the horses; one for the lawn mower; one for church ... the list continues. Each hat brings with it a different task and expectation.At times I am forced to prioritize and choose one hat over the other. The birdhat always has priority during baby season. Sometimes I even delegate and lend certain hats out to responsible helpers. At times I actually try to wear more than one hat ata time. Ifl attend a dog event and have neonates, I have to find room on my head for two hats.AFA, too has many hats on its ever-revolving hat rack. When I am at AF A board meetings, I visualize hats of all types and sizes worn by our dedicated board members. There is the CFO hat; the education hat; the legislative awareness hat; the conservation hat; the disaster relief hat; the convention hat; the publications hat; the membership hat; the media services hat and the specialty organizations hat, just to name a few.The table holds hats that have yet to be named. Sometimes a board member may try a hat that doesn't fit well. If a hat is too tight it causes a headache. No one can be productive with a headache. If a hat is too big, the brim falls over the eyes and a great thought or idea becomes clouded in blindness. It might take find a hat with a really good fit. A hat with an excellent fit usually reflects the passion and interest of the person wearing it.As an AFA member, you might have occasion to try on a few of our hats. One we must wear at all times is the one that promotes aviculture. Because we all share a genuine admiration and respect for birds, the hat that promotes aviculture is a hat with just the right fit.Â </dc:description>
