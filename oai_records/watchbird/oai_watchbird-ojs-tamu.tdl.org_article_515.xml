	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Psittacosis is an infectious diseasein birds which can be transmitted tohumans. This disease process may bemild or serious. It may encompassinfection without symptoms, a transientflu-like syndrome, pneumonia,or serious multi-systemic organ compromiseresulting in death. Fever(99.1%), chills (100%), cough(96.1% ), headache (98.9% ), weaknessor fatigue (100%), and aching allover (99 .1%) were the six most commonlyreported signs and symptomsassociated with psittacosis. Obviouslythese findings are non-specific andfrequently associated with more commonviral or bacterial diseases such as''colds'' or respiratory tract infections.The aforementioned signs andsymptoms were among those frequentlyreported in the 1975 through1984 Psittacosis Surveillance by theCenters for Disease Control (CDC).In fiscal year 1986, approximately700,000 caged birds were brought tothe United States through quarantinestations suggesting potential diseaseexposure to significant numbers ofpersons. For the 1,025 cases withreported source of psittacosis infection,pet cage birds accounted for 719cases (70%). Turkeys accounted for159 cases (15% ), and domestic andwild pigeons accounted for 100( 10% ). The figures and tables fromthe CDC illustrate part of the epidemiologyof psittacosis in the UnitedStates. Diagnosis is challenging, confirmationis slow, and initial evaluationmay be hampered by a low indexof suspicion. In reality, the disease islikely to be missed unless the treatingphysician knows the patient has birdcontact. Initiation of therapy mayprecede laboratory verification ofinfection. It is hoped the followinginformation will prove helpful inunderstanding and preventing thisdisease process.</dc:description>
