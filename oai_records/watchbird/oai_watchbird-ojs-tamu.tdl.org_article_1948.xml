	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dear Editor,I will probably have some free time in the future. Would you be interested in articles dealing with Citron-crested Cockatoos, Crimson-pileated Finches and Red-headed Parrot-finches? I have had considerable success with these species in the last few years. Also, I would like to write a piece entitled something like, "The Joys of a Planted Finch Aviary".I am glad to see you don't shrink from controversy. The other main U.S. cage bird publication, A.C.B.M., seems loathe to print criticism of its articles. I gave up several years ago after my fifth letter commenting on some of the rubbish which had appeared was ignored.Congratulations on producing a fine magazine. The A.F .A. is the best thing which has happened to American aviculture. It is great to see the organization prosper. In the future I hope to take a more active role myself. I would very much like to see one day the AF.A. establish a breeding facility under its control similar to the Pheasant Trust and Wildfowl Trust in Britain. Perhaps initially it could concentrate on the establishment of rare psittacines. A few zoos and private individuals are attempting to establish captive populations of rare species but to my mind an ongoing A.F.A. controlled facility where relatively large numbers of the species concerned (10 or more pairs) could be maintained would be better. A few years ago considerable numbers of the Vinaceous Amazon came into the U.S. This bird is now on the endangered list. Has anybody initiated a breeding program for this bird? Recently considerable numbers of the two Jamaican Amazons have arrived. Both these species deserve to be on the endangered list in my opinion. It is a crying shame to see these very rare birds being sold as pets as is happening. Apart from Ramon Noegel (and he is not really working with sufficient numbers) is anybody seriously trying to establish these birds? What is needed is an organization which can recognize the need and do something positive about it. I hope the A.F.A. will eventually have the enterprise and funds to initiate such an establishment. If the government can see fit to subsidize a plethora of "cultural" activities it might also be persuaded to aid a prestigious organization in efforts to save unique species from extinction. In my opinion this would be money well spent.Lindsay Clack, Ph.D.Morgantown, West VirginiaMy dear Dr. Clack, the readers of the Watchbird would love to read knowledgeable articles on the birds you have mentioned, and of course the "Joys of a Planted Finch Aviary" would be a welcome upbeat. So many aviculturists wind up on the tread-mill of bird chores that they don't have time for the joys of keeping birds. During good weather my wife and I enjoy sitting under a tree in a grassy little garden watching the birds cavort in the banks of aviaries on both sides and with the swans serenely swimming on the pond to the north. In bad weather we enjoy the same thing - the tree leaks less than the house does.We don't shrink from controversy; we rarely refuse to publish a letter even if it seems to be a bit controversial. The only sort of thing I don't like is an attack on an individual based upon personality. I thoroughly enjoy controversy regarding various issues. Unfortunately, many readers can't tell the difference. Sometimes I can't either, I suppose. The main advantage to accepting criticism is that it keeps us fairly honest. Not having the fountain of all knowledge easily at hand, we sometimes publish something that is in obvious error and we depend upon our knowledgeable readers to point it out and correct it. After all, sir, as I have often said, everyone is entitled to their own erroneous opinions. In fact, I am still holding your criticism of some canary material we published a good while ago. I received it a little late to be timely but will publish it the next time we use some canary material (next issue).Your idea on an A.F.A. controlled breeding facility is quite good. I should like to see that happen myself Better yet, I should like to see myself in control of the facility. Come to think of it, everyone I know would like to see themselves in control of it. My qualifications are quite good, however. I am meaner than a junkyard dog and have a .38 to back me up. But then, there may be some younger equally mean fellows with shotguns and rifles who would apply for the job. And then what about the fellows who may not be so mean but have machine guns and artillery? Hmmm. Perhaps we had better establish some ground rules here. Before we need to worry too much, though, the A.F.A. will have to gain more strength, both numerically and financially. The idea is good and I trust that when it becomes feasible, the board of directors will be able to work out the details with no bloodshed. We should study the organization of the Pheasant Trust and the Wildfowl Trust for clues as to how they work. You are entirely correct in suggesting an organized program should be effected to establish in captivity many of the endangered species that are occasionally available. The A.F.A. sponsored Breeders Guide of Nondomesticated Birds is an excellect first step. At present we don't even know what birds are actually in the United States. When we learn that, we will have some hard data to work with in organizing a program and with good luck, enough money, and lots of work, perhaps your admirable dream will come into f ruitition.Ed. </dc:description>
