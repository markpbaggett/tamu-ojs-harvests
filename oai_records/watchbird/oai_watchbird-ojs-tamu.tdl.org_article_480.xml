Along with English trifle and Texas longhorns, their respective places of origin are rather sensibly a part of their name, and thus I will not repeat the obvious. While they are under the same kinds of habitat pressure shared by other avian species of the tropical forest areas , these two species are reported to be holding their own currently. Even though they are highly desirable specimens, they are certainly not commonplace in captivity, and the Malayan crested fireback is becoming especially difficult to obtain. If present trends continue, the Malayan crested fireback will soon be an endangered species in captivity, regardless of its status in the wild .
