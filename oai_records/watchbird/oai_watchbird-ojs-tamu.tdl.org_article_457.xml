	<dc:description xml:lang="en">When I purchased my pair ofEdward's fig parrots from Aves Internationalin February 1987, I had absolutelyno knowledge of the pitfallsthat had already been encountered inboth the keeping and rearing of theiryoung. Perhaps, had I known, Iwould have been dissuaded. I hadseen a picture of a male Edward's figparrot on a Nekton calendar and wasfascinated by his beauty and uniqueness.When I found the birds availablein this country, I did not hesitate topurchase a pair. Since I could findlittle if any information about figparrots, I contacted the San DiegoZoo where Wayne Schulenburg waskind enough to discuss their diet withme. I also learned that there was atendency for them to hemorrhageand that I would have to supplementthem with vitamin K to avoid thispossibility.They arrived healthy and in beautifulcondition. I was delighted withthem, but also apprehensive aboutmy ability to keep them alive andthriving. I had acquired a good supplyof dried Calamyrna figs and alarge bottle of Nekton Q and decidedto offer as wide a variety of fruits as Icould find available. No expense wasspared in this endeavor. The diet I fedand still feed them consists of soakedfigs , soaked light and dark raisins,chopped kiwis, grapes, apples, vari-ous green, leafy vegetables, broccoli,cauliflower, carrots, frozen andthawed corn , peas , string beans ,cooked lentils, split peas and soybeans,pear, raspberries (fresh if possibleor frozen), Zupreem soaked inwater from the figs, and pulverizedZiegler Frugivore pellets sprinkledover the fruit.</dc:description>
