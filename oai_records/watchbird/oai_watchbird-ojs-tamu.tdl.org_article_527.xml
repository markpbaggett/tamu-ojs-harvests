At maturity, it weighs1/2 to 1 ounce (14 to 28 grams), aboutthe weight of a Greenwing Macaw athatching. They have good hearing butpoor eye sight. Like all rodents, theyhave strong , sharp, front chisel-liketeeth which they use to tear openseed bags, gnaw holes in wood andcollect far more food than they willever eat. Mice are constantly harvestingand storing food. They live anywherethey can find food and shelter.They prefer dark , warm and quiethomes ; unused nest boxes are justperfect. They build their nests out ofa variety of materials including grassÂ leaves and feathers.</dc:description>
