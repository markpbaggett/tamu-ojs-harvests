	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I hope that everyone is planning to attend the conference in Tucson in August. If you have never been to one, you do not know what you have missed. If you have not been in years, you should come this year and renew friendships and make some new friends. If you are one of the faithful attendees, I cannot wait to see you again! Many AFA members have been busy this year withÂ legislative activities. We have taken a proactive approach to some federal and state issues. We have supported other groups in their efforts to fight proposed local issues. Unfortunately, these local issues continue to surface, we have to be diligent in our efforts.Grassroots efforts begin with you! There have been individuals who have gone the extra mile this year and they are greatly appreciated. Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Florida, California, and Nevada have all faced some serious legislative issues. The ones where we were successful were the ones that had the most people that participated in the process. Joining with other groups gives us the best chance to have our voices heard. As I begin my second term as president I am thankful to the organization for the work done to preserve our future with our birds. I am thankful to the Board of directors, the committee chairs, the volunteers, and all of those that quietly work behind the scenes because they believe in the mission of the organization. I am thankful to the members who continue to support the organization. I am thankful for all of the members that support our affiliated organizations. I am most thankful for all of the birdkeepers who are passionate...</dc:description>
