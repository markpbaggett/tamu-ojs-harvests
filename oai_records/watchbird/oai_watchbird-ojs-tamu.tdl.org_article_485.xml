	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dear Editor:I have just received the February/March issue of the AFA Watchbird andhave read it with great interest, asalways.Unfortunately, I also found somethingin this issue that made megreatly concerned. This has nothingto do with the articles on aviculture,which are informative and wellwritten. Rather, it concerns an advertisement.On page 24, "Bird Gallery" of SunValley, California, advertises a newfood mix, "Lories Luncheon DryFormula;' that has been designed forlories and lorikeets. The new formulais being pushed (I cannot find a moreappropriate word) on lory keeperswith the promise that the liquiddroppings of lories will become firmlike those of parrots and that the messand cleaning associated with lorykeeping will stop. While I do notquestion the claim of the advertisers,I feel that a strong warning must beissued to all lory keepers about anyproducts that are designed to makethe digestion of lories more acceptableto housekeepers.</dc:description>
