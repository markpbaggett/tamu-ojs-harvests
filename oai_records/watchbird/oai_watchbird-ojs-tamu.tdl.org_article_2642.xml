	<dc:description xml:lang="en">It is a well-known fact that only a small percentage of our cage and aviary birds are fed according to their physiological needs, while many others are more or less forced to take items of food which they, in general, are not accustomed to. Take, for example, the various lory species which are frequently just "kept alive" with various seeds, when the natural diet of most consists mainly of nectar and pollen, plus fruits, blossoms, berries, buds and ( especially the smaller and medium sized species, Lorius, Trichoglossus, etc.) some insects and seeds. Indeed, lories and lorikeets play an important role in the natural pollination of many flowering trees and plants. In this respect, I like Rosemary Low's remark, "I feel strongly that anyone who is not prepared to go to the bother of providing lories with fresh nectar daily should keep seed eaters, or preferably not keep birds at all." The "amateur" birdkeeper with just one or two birds is often the culprit who, usually through ignorance, will provide his birds with just commercial packet seed and, sometimes, a few supplementary table scraps.One of the most common faults is giving birds in small cages food which is too rich in energy. The natural progression from this is birds which are too fat. This is especially evident in pet budgies (parakeets). Budgerigars weighing more than 30 grams can be regarded as obese and require a change in diet and much more room to move about! Unfortunately, there are lots of budgies which weigh 50 to 60 grams. Dr. Gerstenfeld hits the nail on the head when he says such birds ''would need a long runway to get off the ground." I am convinced that there is double meaning to this statement.Another error often made is giving a too monotonous diet. This soon leads to problems - especially with the so-called seed eating species. This problem usually arises with single, tame pet parrots or parakeets, which are allowed to "eat at the table;' receiving all manner of smoked, salted, spiced items which are really totally alien to the bird and can do a lot of damage.There are many other incredible feeding mistakes made by some ''bird fanciers" and I hope, in this introduction to the feeding of parrots and parakeets, to steer the serious hobbyist in the right direction. I have been fortunate in being able to study birds in various parts of the world and as an aviculturist have been engaged with many species of cage and aviary birds, both professionally and as a hobbyist. The proverb, "So many men, so many minds;' is very appropriate to our fancy, especially with regard to feeding. One may frequently hear the statement that if a certain foodstuff "works" (that the birds appear, for the time being, healthy), then one is on the right track! Is that really right? Would a gradual change in the menu (and I would emphasize "gradual") perhaps work even better, and encourage the birds to breed?I can say with conviction that a good diet is one which keeps a bird at an optimal standard of health, full of energy and joie de vive. A good diet will guarantee a long, trouble-free life for all of our birds. As we keep the birds in our homes and gardens, we must take the full responsibility of their care and management on our shoulders - including the provision of the best diet imaginable. If we are not prepared to do this, then we should not be involved with the bird fancy, at least never keep them in cages or aviaries.It is well known that cage and aviary birds have entertained man for many, many generations. There is, indeed, a great variety of bird accommodations, and bird-keepers may be found among every level of the population from bus drivers to medical practitioners and from garbage collectors to dukes. From these groups of people the specialists have arisen.Most hobbyists are, understandably, members of a national or local bird society or club. One can also be a member of a specialist club which deals with a particular type of bird; lovebirds, canaries, cockatiels, for example. The members usually receive a regular magazine or newsletter will all sorts of useful information and there are exhibitions, meetings and various bird markets all of which add to our collective knowledge of the birds. I consider membership of such a club to be of utmost importance to every bird fancier.Much has been done with regard to species descriptions and there are many interesting books on this subject. Field guides are often very useful in identifying particular species or subspecies. Meritorious work on the accommodations of cage and aviary birds has also been carried out, while studies on diseases and treatments of such birds are becoming ever more important. Various universities carry out much useful research, and the Association of Avian Veterinarians has various, exceptionally expert, avian veterinarians among its members.Over the years, many bird foods from the native lands of the birds have been....</dc:description>
