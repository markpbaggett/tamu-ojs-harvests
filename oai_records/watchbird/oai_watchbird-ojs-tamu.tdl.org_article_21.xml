	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A recent article in the Smithsonian described a program of captive breeding of pheasant species threatened with extinction. The program is conducted by the Pheasant Trust in England and has as its goal the production of those birds in sufficient quantities so that their natural habitat can eventually be restored. Such a breeding program is not confined to England. Mr. Jack Moore of Whittier, California has been actively breeding ornamental phea ants for a period of 15 years. Starting in the bu iness as a commercial breeder of Ringneck pheasants for the dinner table, he became intere ted in ornamentals and now devotes his time to the breeding of ornamental pecies. His sales are to hobbiests and dealers in this country and in many foreign countries.</dc:description>
