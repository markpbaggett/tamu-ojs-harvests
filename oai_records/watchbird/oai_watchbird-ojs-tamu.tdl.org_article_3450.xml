	<dc:description xml:lang="en">One of the safest, most and most economical mode of transportation to fly on commercial airlines. Unfortunately, it can also be the most restrictive and therefore more ftrustrating experiences if one is flying with birds and unaware of the rules and regulations.As someone that regularly flies 20,000 to 50,000 miles per year with birds, I hope to help alleviate the difficulties bird owners can encounter when flying with their birds. It has always been my experience that the best way to overcome obstacles is to evaluate and understand the situation from the opposite viewpoint. This often provides the best tactical advantage in order to achieve success. The issues raised from the prospective of both the airlines and the government, two separate entities but both of which need to be addressed by the bird-flying public, will allow everyone to have a stress-free experience when flying with birds.When flying with birds, owners must realize that they are dealing with two separate but necessary components of the aviation industry that can either prevent or allow a successful flight. Those components are the Federal government, which regulates airline security under the Transportation Security Administration and the airlines themselves, which formulate the rules and restrictions for their individual planes. It is vital to understand the motives and goals of each in order to achieve a successful flying experience. I will present these issues and ideas as well as how to deal with them effectively. One thing that,aviculturalist must remember is that flying is a privilage, NOT A RIGHT. There is nothing in the Constitution , the United States that guarantees anyone the right to fly on an airplane. Furthermore, JL}dng-wiffi pets, including birds, is also a privilege and not something that other members of the public might appreciate. Airlines are businesses and as such, they need to make money to stay in business. Some airlines will not allow birds or any animalson their flights at all and as a business, that is their prerogative. Some of the major airlines that DO NOT ALLOW birds on their flights are:• Frontier Airlines• Jet Blue Airlines• Southwest AirlinesAll bird owners need to check with their airline PRIOR to booking a flight. Some airlines will accommodate members of the bird flying public under limited conditions. This is for the health and safety of other members of the public that are also their customers. It is the owner's responsibility to understand and comply with these rules and regulations. If not, the airlines do not have to allow people to fly with their birds.  </dc:description>
