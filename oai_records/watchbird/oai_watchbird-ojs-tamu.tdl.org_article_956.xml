	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the last issue you got a sense ofhow much joy I had in participatingin the AFA convention. In this issue wehope to convey some of the glowingpleasures and sense of growth othersgot from the same convention.One of the many highlights we alllike is the recognition various folksreceive for having done good things inaviculture. The AFA has for many yearsgiven the prestigeous AVI Awards to aselect few persons who have donemore than their share to enhance variousaspects of American aviculture.U.S. First Breeding Awards are givento the individual or organization whichis responsible for breeding a species orsubspecies of bird hitherto not bred inthe United States. The dynamicsbehind these first breedings are veryconvoluted and complicated and cannotbe predicted by formula. But it isto the great advantage of aviculturethat there are zoos and private breederswho are constantly working withdifficult birds. These birds are generallyan expense, not an asset. Those personsand institutions listed below havehad good luck, good technique, perseverenceand dedication in their aviculturalefforts. The AFA honors them fortheir first breedings. These AVI Awardswere presented by Dale Thompson,Chairman of the Awards Committee, ata fine Friday luncheon that was one ofthe highlights of the whole convention.Â Awards went to:The Toledo Zoo, for the Red-throatedGaudy Barbet, Megalaima mystacophanoshatched 6 September 1992.Stash Buckley and Carol Anne Calvinfor the Pin-tailed Nonpariel Parrot Finch,Erythura prasina hatched 7 July 1989.The Houston Zoological Gardensfor the Crowned Hornbill, Tockusalhoterminatus that hatched on 17September 1993.In addition to the first U.S. breedingawards, AVI Awards are also given tothe two authors whose Watchbird articleshave been deemed the best duringthe preceeding calendar year. Theseawards are of necessity somewhatsubjective but a panel of skilled andastute judges come to as fair and unbiaseda decision as can be made.For 1994 one award went to Joseflindholm ill for "Focus on Finches ... BuffaloWeavers" WatchbirdMarch/ April 1994.The second award went to LesGibson for "Breeding the BrownbackedSolitaire" Watchbird Sep!Oct1994.Our great appreciation for the workand talent displayed by these twoexcellent gentlemen and for their topnotch contributions to the literature ofmodern aviculture.There were many other specialawards presented by PresidentDesborough to folks who have beenespecially helpful within the AFA.These are the unsung heroes of ourorganization. This time, however,President Desborough sang their praisesand bestowed well deserved honors.We all enjoyed the laughter and tears ofthe emotional handshakes and embraces.There is always so much going on atan AFA convention that we can't hope toconvey the whole impact in these pages.You really have to be there to appreciateit. Dianne Livengood has publishedin this issue a bit of her conventionexperiences. Be sure to read her article.She does a good job of explainingwhy one should attend AFA conventions.</dc:description>
