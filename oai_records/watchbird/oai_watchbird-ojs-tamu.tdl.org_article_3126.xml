	<dc:description xml:lang="en">From the Editor- Thank you to everyone who responded to the "Identify This Baby" in the previous Watchbird. I must say, that even with all the responses we received, no one had the correct answer. The most common answers were Golden Conure and various Rosella species.The photo was of a baby Greater Vasa Parrot (Coracopsis vasa). The photo above shows him at 35 days of age. The most identifying clues in the earlier image as to his species were the "pearls" on the side of the beak and the color of the skin on the chick's head and nape.I look forward to publishing another challenge to our readership in the future. Please feel free to submit your own photos for consideration. Contact me at afawatchbird@earthlink.net for details. - Mark MooreÂ </dc:description>
