	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Currently there is a resurgence of interestand even anxiety over an apparentlyreal increase in the number of provenand suspect cases of psittacosis reportedin both humans and birds. The report ofthe Infectious Disease Section of theState Department of Health confirms thediagnosis of at least 20 human cases during1975, the largest number of cases inover a decade. Since the latter part ofOctober, 1975, our laboratory has diagnosed11 cases in birds and is studyingseveral more. It has reached the pointwhere at least two public health officialshave suggested that we solve the problemby prohibiting the sale of all birds. Thissimplistic approach must be resisted andreplaced by a more realistic solution devisedby all concerned parties workingtogether. In pursuit of such a solution,all recognized pet or exotic bird veterinarianswere invited to meet for an eveningdiscussion of psittacosis on February24 at the San Gabriel Laboratory. Plansare currently underway to have a daylong symposium on psittacosis in thesecond week of May. Recognized researchers,state and federal regulatoryofficials, quarantine station operators,wholesalers, representatives of the moreprominent aviculture societies, etc. willall join for a thorough review of thecurrent problem in all of its aspects and,hopefully, will propose answers for someof the more pressing problems. If answersare not to be had, hopefully, research willbe initiated when the problem areas aremore clearly defined. In addition, we arescheduled to address two bird clubs onthe subject of psittacosis, in March. Thereis also an informative newsletter beingcirculated to many dealers, retailers andowners of cage and aviary birds by theCooperative Extension of the Universityof California. You will be kept abreast offurther developments in this effort andwe solicit your comments, suggestionsand questions at any time.</dc:description>
