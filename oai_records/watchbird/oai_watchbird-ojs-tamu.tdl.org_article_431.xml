	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Wild CanaryThe wild canary (Serinus canarius)was first discovered in the early 1400sinhabiting the Canary Islands, Madeiraand the Azores. The wild canary isolive green in color with several blackand brown stripes on its back. There isa greenish-yellow strip on his forehead, with the regions above andunder the eye, on the sides of the headand on the neck also a greenish yellow.The chief difference between the maleand female is that on the breast andabdomen of the female grayish-whitecolor takes the place of the greenishyellow of the male.The green canary is still being bredby fanciers who know the value of theoriginal color and vigor. Since the1400s, many mutations have occurredand have been preserved by canarybreeders. Most mutations are in theform of new colors. However, somemutations are evident in the form offeather shape and feather arrangement.Color mutations are divided into twogroups, the Melanins and the Lipochromes.</dc:description>
