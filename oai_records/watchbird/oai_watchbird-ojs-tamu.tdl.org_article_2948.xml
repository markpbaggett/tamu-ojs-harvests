	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In 1934 a small group of far sighted and enthusiastic game bird breeders conceived the idea of forming an organization; the purpose primarily for exchanging ideas, and increasing its knowledge of gamebirds and wild waterfowl in general. This was the meager beginning of the California Game Breeders Association, which is now the oldest club of its kind in the country. In 1937, the organization was incorporated under the Agriculture Code of California. Business of the Association is administered by a nine member Board of Directors.The C.G.B.A. has published bulletins on a monthly basis since becoming incorporated. The bulletin is mailed to all members and prospective members. It contains news of the regular meetings, coming events, news of members, and helpful information on raising game birds. The low cost "want ad" section is run for the benefit of the members. A Membership List and Breeders Guide is published every two years. It gives the name and phone number of each member and the species of birds he raises.Monthly meetings are held on the first Wednesday evening of each month. The program committee provides interesting and educational meetings. Slides and movies relating to game birds and waterfowl are shown. Expert breeders, equipment manufacturers, and feed dealers speak on breeding, care, marketing and other problems of the game bird raiser. Question and answer round table discussions are held. The novice has the opportunity of having his problems discussed by more experienced members. Anyone who is interested in game birds or waterfowl is welcome to attend the meetings.Each year attractive and diversified bird farms are selected for an all day tour. They include the back yard hobbyists as well as commercial game bird farms.The two main events are an Annual Exhibit at the Los Angeles County Fair, and an Annual Game Bird Show. The County Fair has attendance that exceeds one million visitors. The C.G.B.A. Fair Exhibit attracts alot of attention for the good of aviculture. The Annual Game Bird Show began by assembling and showing birds in the backyards of C.G.B.A. members. This show has been held for over 30 years. Show efforts have increased each year and now the Annual Game Bird Show is the largest and most outstanding show in the country.For more information about this active club contact the membership secretary, Lola Whittem, 10323 Rio Hondo Parkway, El Monte, CA 91733.
