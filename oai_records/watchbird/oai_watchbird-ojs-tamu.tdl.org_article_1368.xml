	<dc:description xml:lang="en">IntroductionThe Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) has developed various breeding programs to address the need to responsibly manage captive populations of a species. The zoological community utilizes computer software developed by an organization called International Species Information System (ISIS), based in the Minnesota Zoological Gardens. One of the essential elements of an AZA breeding program is accurate studhook data of the species in the Single Population Animal Records Keeping System (SPARKS) format. SP ARKS is utilized hy all studbook keepers and an annual class is taught at the AZA Conservation Academy at Oglebay Park in Wheeling, WV.Many zoo keepers have entered the zoo business as a result of their expertise in private sector facilities. The inclusion of the experience of reputable private breeders can only add to our ability to save species. It is a desire of the zoological community to work with established private sector breeders on cooperative programs and Breeding Consortia are one of our methods for accomplishing this goal. The Cuban Amazon Consortium is currently the only existing program of its kind. In the post, AZA Species Survival Plans® (SSP) have evolved by starting out as a Breeding Consortium, such as the Palm Cockatoo SSP®.Cuban Amazon Consortium FormationThe current managed population of Cuban Amazons, A. l. leucocepbala, began as a group of U. S. Department of Interior seized birds in Miami, Florida, on 4 April 1988. The Cuban Amazon Consortium (CAC) was championed by Ron Johnson, former Bird Curator/Metrozoo. On 8 May 1991, the signature of Robert 0. Wagner, former AZAJExecutive Director, to the official document known as the ·AAZPA BREEDING CONSORTIUM AGREEMENT is how the CAC was formed. The founder group of birds were then turned over to the Miami Metrozoo on 27 May 1988, due the agreement between the AZA and the U. S. D. I./Fish and Wildlife Service. In the summer of 1991, birds were shipped to the selected Participants of the CAC for breeding.TaxonomyThe description being used for this species, has been that of Joseph M. &amp;gt; Forshaw per AZA Parrot Taxon ~ Advisory Group (TAG) protocol. The ~ nominate race is considered to he the ~ one found on main.land Cuba. The AZA ~ Parrot TAG is developing a Regional ~0Collection Plan (currently in progress) ~and standards for nomenclature are ~ being adopted to standardize records § keeping. As is usual, these taxonomic if classifications can change due to current definitions. There are five recognized subspecies: Amazona leucocepbala leucocepha!a - Mainland Cuba;A. l.palmarum- Isle of Youth, A. I. c~vmanensis - Grand Cayman; A. l. besterna - Cayman Brae, Little Cayman; andA. I. babameusis - Bahamas. The historical studbook will eventually include all five subspecies, hut the CUITent studbook only represents the managed population.RangeThe Cuban Amazon is restricted to eastern and central Cuba. According to Juniper and Parr 0998), the main areas of concentrated populations are Zapata and Guanahacahihes peninsulas and in Sierra de Najasa on mainland Cuba. In 1988, the Cuban Amazon population was estimated at 5,000 individuals. there are no current numbers available as of this writing.They commonly inhabit the woodlands of the mountains and lowlands (Bond, 56) of mainland Cuba. A combination of pines and palms are found in the wooded areas of their habitat. Wild DietAlthough current information is not available yet from field studies. there are observations of wild Culx111 Amazons consuming the following: fruits, seeds, nuts, berries, leaf buds. and blossoms of indigenous plants. They have also been observed eating crops of banana, plantains, papaya. mango, guava, pimiento, and grape fruit. Cones and tender shoots of pine are believed to he part of their diet, hut only observations of Caribbean pine species have been noted.Social StructureThe Cuban Amazon is known to he a gregarious bird, found in flocks as large as 42 individuals in the Zapata region of Cuba (Mitchell and Wells, 97). During the breeding season it is not uncommon to see them in pairs, lone birds, or smaller flocks of individuals (Forshaw, 73). </dc:description>
