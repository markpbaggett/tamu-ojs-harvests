	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This strikingly beautiful and very rare mutation exists probably only in Australia. As a nestling it was rejected and abandoned by its parents, probably because of its "wrong" coloration. The chick was hand reared to maturation by its present owner and has a very pleasant, steady disposition. She was a pleasure to photograph.At the moment this hen is paired to a male who is split for lutino. So far there has been no attempt to breed although the hen has shown interest in the nest log. Only test breeding and time will reveal whether this mutation is simply recessive or sex-linked genetically.Editor's Note: Australian auiculturists are able to make arrangements to legally keep and breed their native birds which is a great boon to Australian aviculture. In the U.S.A. most native American birds are illegal to keep in American aviaries. Personally, I should be happy if the U.S. government would allow more captive breeding of our native species. • </dc:description>
