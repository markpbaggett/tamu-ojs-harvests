During the 2012 breeding season the Orange-breasted Fig-parrots ( Cyclopsitta gulielmitertii) as well as the Double-eyed Fig-parrots (Cyclopsitta diophthalma) successfully parent-reared their young. Germany-wide, both species can only be seen in Weltvogelpark Walsrode.All the seven recognized subspecies of the Orange-breasted Fig-parrot inhabit rain, monsoon and swamp forest in lowlands and hilly regions up to 1100 m on New Guinea and surrounding islands. In the wild the main breeding season is between December and June. These fig-parrots nest in a hole that they excavate themselves in an arboreal termitarium. In contrast, the Double-eyed Fig-parrots nest in existing cavities in a hollow of a high tree or in a rotten tree trunk or limb. This species has eight recognized subspecies which are found on New Guinea and on the Northeast coast of Australia. Double-eyed Fig-parrots inhabit lowland and montane forest, mangroves and more open woodland up to 2000 m. The main breeding season occurs between March and June in New Guinea, while in Australia the birds mainly breed between August and November.A special feature, alluded to in their name, is the diet of these small parrots-in the wild they mainly feed on fruits of various fig trees, preferring the seeds rather than the flesh of the figs. Additionally, a variety of other fruits and berries, nectar and also insects and their larvae are taken.In captivity experiences have shown that fig-parrots are very sensitive to disturbance, especially during the breeding season. Changes in their direct surroundings as well as at the nest box can unsettle them. It is very important to deal with the birds very carefully in order to breed them successfully.To encourage our breeding pairs of Orange-breasted Fig-parrots to start breeding, we construct nest boxes with a size of 30 cmx20cmx20 cm (lengthxwidthxheight) that are placed in the enclosures behind the scenes. These nest boxes are made of waterproof particle board. An entrance hole with a diameter of 4 to 6 cm is provided on both sides of the boxes. The boxes are entirely filled with natural cork tiles. The cork is scratched a bit at the entrance hole to provide the birds with a starting point to begin excavating their nest cavity in the cork tiles. Digging the cavity together stimulates the pair's breeding instinct. Once the nest cavity is approximately 8 to 10 cm in diameter, the female lays her eggs-normally two, but one or three eggs are possible. The young hatch after an incubation period of about 20 to 22 days. The parents adjust the size of the nest cavity to the size of their growing offspring. These birds are tidy by nature-the chicks deposit their faeces directly out of the nest box so that the interior stays clean.In contrast to the Orange-breasted Fig parrots, the Double-eyed Fig-parrots are provided with a natural wooden trunk as nesting box. The cavity is approximately 20 cm x 25 cm (width x height) with a diameter of about 15 cm. The entrance hole is about 4 to 6 cm in diameter and situated 20 cm above the nest floor maximally. The nest floor is lined with wood shavings.As soon as a pair of fig-parrots has eggs, the birds are left in peace until the approximate hatch date of the chicks. Shortly afterwards, the nest box is inspected, but only when the female has left the box to feed.Â </dc:description>
