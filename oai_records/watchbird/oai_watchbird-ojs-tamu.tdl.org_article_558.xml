	<dc:description xml:lang="en">When Anna Colbeck purchased ayoung pair of Hawk-headed Parrotsnearly ten years ago, she thought toherself, ' 'This pair is going to breed.''Not long out of quarantine, theyw ere wild but not frightened ofpeople, having been partially handfed but not socialized as pets. Dueto their mostly brown foreheadsstreaked with white, they are possiblyof the subspecies Deroptyusaccipitrinus fuscifrons (according tothe description in Forshaw's Parrots ofthe World). She named them Maggie and Jiggsand, not having a cage ready at thetime, released them into an 80 by 30foot greenhouse where they haveremained ever since. Their ''L"shaped nest box, about 18" by 24"deep, hangs from the ceiling. Theymake a game of dive-bombing anystrangers who enter the greenhouse,coming close enough to touch thepeople with their wingtips, makingthem duck. When Anna comes inwith the food buckets, they comedown to investigate what's for dinner;otherwise they keep to themselves.</dc:description>
