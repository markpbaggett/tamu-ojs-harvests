	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Hummingbirds some lesser known facts</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The family Trochilidae is extremelydiverse. Such attributes as plumagedifferences (some species are ratherdrab coloured where as others havespectacular iridescent plumageand/or ornamentation) is well documented.However, certain attributesare not so well known and it is myintention to discuss some of theselesser known facts.As I shall mention whether or notcertain species under discussion canbe established in captivity, I feel Ishould explain exactly what I meanby this. In my opinion a hummingbirdcannot be considered establisheduntil it has undergone at least one fullmoult in captivity. The true characterof a species often does not becomeapparent until it has been fullymoulted. Once the moult is completed,many species which, up untilthen, have proven docile, maybecome extremely aggressive andremain so for the remainder of theirlives. Certain species which have notbeen heard to sing will, after thecrucial first moult, become vocal.Furthermore, many species, onceestablished, may perform sexualdisplays hitherto not seen.Not all species alter so dramaticallyafter the first moult; indeed manyeasily managed hummingbirds, oncethey have settled into their quarters,will be heard to sing regularly andmany will often display. Even so, thetrue character of such species maybecome more pronounced after thefirst full moult in captivity.</dc:description>
