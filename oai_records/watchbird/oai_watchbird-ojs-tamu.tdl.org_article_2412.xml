	<dc:description xml:lang="en">CHILTON, WI - Kaytee Products Incorporated president, William Engler, Jr., announced recently that the Chilton, Wisconsin, firm will sponsor the 1st Annual Kaytee Great American Bird Show on October 2-4, 1986. According to Engler, the site of the show will be the Ramada O'Hare in Chicago, which has completed a $15 million refurbishing project since hosting the 1984 National Cage Bird Show.The Kaytee Great American Bird Show will carry the usual show format much farther by inviting Chicago-area pet stores to participate in the commercial exhibit section. The show will open its doors to the public in an effort to promote pet bird ownership. "Our primary reason for developing a 'selling' show,'' said show director Harvey Smith, "not only increases public awareness of pet bird ownership benefits, but brings the buying public into direct contact with a knowledgeable seller. Prospective bird owners from the Chicago-land area will be treated to a variety of exciting and informative activities ranging from educational seminars to exhibitions of performing birds.Kaytee's director of nutritional research, Dr. Randal Brue, will assist in guiding the show format activities and educational seminars for show participants by heading a special advisory committee of well-known industry representatives. Those serving on the 1986 Advisory Committee are: William Parlee, president, National Finch Society; Ermafern Collins, president, Amercian Budgerigar Society; Russell Armitage, Jr., vice president, National Finch Society; Dr. Al Decoteau, Society of Parrot Breeders and Exhibitors; Lee Horton, American Love Bird Society; and Nancy Reed, American Cockatiel Society.In addition to trophies and ribbons, substantial cash awards will be offered in every division, as well as Best of Show category. Each division will be directly responsible for selecting and sponsoring a judge, with show rules and regulations being similar to other major events.Smith, a veteran producer of national and regional promotional events, admits that one of the show's primary objectives will be to introduce the fun and excitement of bird ownership to the general public. ''The opportunity for show particpants to do more than just sell birds to the general public will be greater than ever before;' according to Smith. "In addition, each club and association attending the show will have an opportunity to not only demonstrate the qualities of the birds they represent and educate the general public to the responsibilities of bird ownership, but to look for new members as well.''Plans to attract coverage of the show from not only Chicago-area press but national media as well, represent a major organizational priority for show management.Clubs and organizations planning on attending this first-of-a-kind event next October may contact Connie Heimerl for additional show information and hotel room registration cards by calling 1-800-558-3502 or by writing Great American Bird Show, Kaytee Products, P.O. Box 230, Chilton, WI 53014. eÂ </dc:description>
