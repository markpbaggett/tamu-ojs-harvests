	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Whenever people ask me to recommenda good place to buy an exoticbird, I urge them to contact localbreeders through one of the PugetSound area bird clubs. Generally I donot recommend pet stores. Why? Inthe first place, a buyer who wants toshop at a pet store will find a responsibleone through the bird club. In thesecond place, too many pet stores sellwild-caught birds without regard towhether or not those birds willbecome good pets.When I was a child I fell in lovewith parrots after meeting only two.Both, belonging to the families offriends, were kept in cages full-time.One was a double yellow head; theother might have been a greencheek. Iwas warned to keep my fingers awayfrom the cages, to watch from a distance.And watch I did. I loved theirmovements, their expressions, theircolor. Yet I could have no interactionwith them nor could they with anyother living creature. They were wildcaughtAmazons that had "turnedvicious'' or that their owners hadgiven up training. Such birds oftenlive short lives, their health run downby malnutrition, lack of exercise, andunclean conditions. Often they aresold and resold to unsuspectingnovices.</dc:description>
