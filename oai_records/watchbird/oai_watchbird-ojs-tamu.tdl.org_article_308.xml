	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The four of us were sitting in NewOrleans' famous Arnaud's Restaurant.Across from me was Theo Pagel, Jr.; tomy left his father, Theo Pagel, thefamous German lorikeet expert; and tomy right, Paul Roth, a Swiss ornithologistwho now lives in northern Braziland whose specialty is parrots. Ourdiscussion centered on parrots, thensuddenly it turned to hybrids. Wfthhesitation I explained having seen avery unusual, indeed almost incredulous,cross in Australia- the offspringof a male rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossushaematodus moluccanus) anda female king parrot (Alisterus scapularis).I expected Pagel to react the sameway I did when first hearing of the bird- my eyebrows raised, facial expressionclearly showing that I did not believethe cross was possible, and then askingthe person telling me the story if theyhad been drinking - but he did not;in his soft-spoken words, he relatedanother peculiar happening: the rearingof hybrids between a macaw (Ara spp.)and Pionites or caique. These two birdsare as separate from each other as theÂ lorikeet and king.</dc:description>
