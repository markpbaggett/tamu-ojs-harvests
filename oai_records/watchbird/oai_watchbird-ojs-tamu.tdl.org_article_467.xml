The idea of surgical sexing clinics came about as a result of several concepts that came together coincidentally several years ago. The foremost influence came about in the form of Dr. Scott McDonald , who is well-known for his efforts to promote avicultural medicine and domestic propagation.Dr. McDonald was concluding his residency at the University of California at Davis at the time I was beginning my own, and his approach to the problems of aviculture as a veterinarian was both unique and effective in northern California at the time. The other major factors that presented themselves in the 1980s were the reality that foreign bird importation had begun to show signs of decreasing.
