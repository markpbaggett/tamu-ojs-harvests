	<dc:title xml:lang="en">EX LIBRIS - THE SWIFT PARAKEET</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">To mark the new millennium, The Parrot Society in the UK has come up with a superb initiative that will benefit all members, old and new who have paid their subscriptions for the year 2000. Each member is being presented free of charge with a copy of a new book - The Swift Parakeet. This is in addition to the 12 monthly magazines that they will receive.In July 1998, the Parrot Society approached Cyril Laubscher, the internationally renowned photographer and author, to produce a special publication. The result is a well-produced book - the first ever to be published on the enigmatic Swift Parakeet.In nine months, Cyril travelled some 80,000 miles to photograph the Swift Parakeet in its natural environment in Tasmania and Australia. Other photographic trips took him to Europe and South Africa before he was satisfied that sufficient photographic material was available for the book.This outstanding book, 10 x 7 inches (240 mm x 170 mm) overall, consists of 48 pages of informative text highlighting the plight of this unique parakeet, which is now classified as nationally endangered in Australia.It is lavishly illustrated with 75 superb full colour photographs throughout. Virtually every page features a colour photograph or two. Pictures of Swift Parakeets in flight - to show important plumage detail - abound throughout the book. As many of our readers will know, Cyril specializes in flight photography and has used his skill to create a unique record of this colorful parakeet.A unique series of three close up photographs of a Swift Parakeet, Stella's Lorikeet, and Jobi's Lory - all with their tongues extended - illustrates the difference in the length and shape of these three nectar-feeding members of the parrot family. There are other photographs of birds feeding in the wild, food sources, scientific researchers fitting transmitters and using radio tracking devices, habitat, etc.The first half of the book deals largely with the current scientific research being conducted in the field by the Swift Parrot Recovery Plan team to ensure the long-term survival of this beautiful parakeet.In the second half, important avicultural aspects are covered and fully illustrated. Photographs show housing in different parts of the world and var- ious foods used by breeders. Artwork features four nestbox designs. And the three mutations that have been bred and established in Europe are fully illustrated photographically.To complement the scientific research, Cyril implemented an avicultural research program among breeders in the USA, Canada, South Africa, Australia, and in a number of European countries, to obtain as much information as possible. Various societies offered assistance - the Parrot Society (UK), Parkieten Societeit in Holland, Club des Oiseax Exotique in France, and the Avicultural Society of Australia. A total of 72 questionnaires were returned, providing a basis for estimating the current global status, and other important avicultural information.Cyril maintains that The Swift Parakeet book is the result of international cooperation between scientific field researchers, avicultural societies, and breeders worldwide. They have willingly contributed to ensure that this. book will provide aviculturists with an insight to the plight of this unique parakeet in the wild. And, most importantly, -, the role that aviculture is continuing to play in ensuring that this delightful parakeet is saved for future generations.The Parrot Society UK - without whom this project would have been difficult to implement - left the entire project and book production in Cyril's hands. The initiative and encouragement that they provided, has resulted in a publication that any aviculturist would be proud to own.New members are welcomed, and those who join and pay the $21 ($20 + $1 USA check clearance charge) subscription fee for the year will automatically receive The Swift Parakeet book, and the 12 magazines from January to December 2000.Air mail postage is $15 extra {Total $36). </dc:description>
