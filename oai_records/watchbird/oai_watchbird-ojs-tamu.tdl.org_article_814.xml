	<dc:description xml:lang="en">• What's a Breeder to Do?I and my family had hoped toenhance the survival of several speciesof birds which, without help,would most likely appear in a futurebook under "extinct." This effort wasto be our "offering" as it were - ourgiving something back to nature.We fell in love with the GoldenConure and there our troubles began.We eventually found some in anotherstate that were available. The breedersaid we'd have to get permits from theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to movethese CITES Appendix I birds across astate line. When I called Washington,D.C. about a permit, I was shocked atthe amount of information requested- photos and drawings of my aviaries,why I want the birds, detailsof my bird breeding activities, whatbirds I currently hold and breed,deaths of any birds during the past sixmonths, etc.Why all the details, I asked. Thepolite but cool voice explained theinformation was necessary to controlthe transportation issues and to determineif the applicant is qualified tohave the birds. The government wantsto know who has the birds and why. Ireceived the impression over thephone that hell would freeze overbefore I received a permit to get theGolden Conures.I was shocked at the amount ofgovernmental control. As the endangeredspecies list grows, will additional species become more difficultto propagate - or even to own? A policy must be issued by the AF Aon the subject, and guidelines must beestablished so we in the avian communitycan police our own affairs -not the federal government. Maybe allthe information the federal governmentrequires could be covered by theMAP program through the AF A.Soon the only birds we may havewill be the pictures in our avianbooks.Michael H. GilbertProsser, WashingtonMAP is an independent voluntaryprogram for the certification of aviculturiststhrough a system of inspectionby avian veterinarians. For moreinformation, contact MAP, P. 0. Box1657, Martinez, CA 94553.The AFA Exotic Bird Registry is aprogram available through the AFAwhereby you can log your qualitybirds in a computerized registry systemsomewhat akin to the AKC-zyperegistry for dogs. These programs donot overlap and all aviculturists areencouraged to participate in both.Contact the AFA Home Office at1-800-BIRDCALL for more information.Ed.• • •• Where's the Brotogeris?The May/June 1994 edition of AFAWatchbird front cover reads "Conures,Forpus and Brotogeris." Great! Iraise those little guys; it's about timesomeone wrote a few things; maybe Ican learn a little bit.I cannot well enough express myconcern that any well-known Brotogerisbreeders could not take the timeto contribute an article to your magazine.I don't wish to call it a "magazine"because it is more a compendiumof information, uncluttered byexcessive commercial advertisements.The reason for this letter is the lackof any reasonable article in an issuethat advertised Brotogeris on the frontcover. Inside I found only a shortarticle written by Jose Aleman that, inaddition to being out of date, indicatedhe no longer raises GreycheekedParakeets. I really feel thatyou should have left off the referenceto Brotogeris on the front coverhaving only that one short article. 'Tom WettlauferCTW AviaryLake Mary, Florida• • •• Saving the Planet?I have just finished reading E.O.Wilson's The Diversity of Life, and ithelped me collect some ideas I hadabout conservation issues. I tried toarticulate the discomfort I have fe~among avicu~urists in relation to thepolitically correct positions abouttrade regulation bills, captive breedingprograms and other environmentalissues.While I have pet birds and couldn'tlive without them, I would neverknowingly support an environmentallyor ecologically unethical practice.I know most of my bird club acquaintancesfeel the same way. It is alwaysdifficult to evaluate the full environmentalimpact of any action, becausethe issues are so complex. However, Ihave felt disturbed by the simplisticposition that some articles [in aviculturalmagazines] take about conservation.Some groups seem to want us tobelieve that as long as we breedparrots we are saving the planet. Iwish this were more true. There is alot of misinformation and confusionabout parrot conservation amongaviculturists.Delia BerlinBolton Connecticut</dc:description>
