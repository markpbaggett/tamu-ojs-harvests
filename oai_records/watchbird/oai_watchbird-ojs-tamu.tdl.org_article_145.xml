	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dear Sirs:WE GETLETTERSI am interested in keeping one of thelarger parrots as a pet. I would only wanta very young bird, and am skeptical ofthe age and health of birds I see in petstores. Also, with my experiences withpure bred dogs and cats, I am well awarethat much better animals can be purchasedfrom breeders than from pet shops,and usually at much lower prices. I donot knowlif this is true of the bird fancierâ€¢but I would like to investigate all possibilitiesbefore making a purchase.Does anyone breed African Greys orAmazons in this country? If so, could Iplease have some names and addresses ofbreeders I could contact? I would alsolike to know if there is a parrot club Icould write to.Thank you very much.P.G.Dear Madam:Your letter of inquiry regarding keepingone of the larger parrots as a pet isone of several indicating the increasedinterest, by people in the United States,in birds.</dc:description>
