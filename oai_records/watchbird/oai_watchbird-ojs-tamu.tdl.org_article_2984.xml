	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The North American Game Breeders &amp;amp; Shooting Preserve Association, Inc. is holding a National Convention and Short Course Jan. 8-12, 1979 at Hilton Airport Plaza Inn, Kansas City, Missouri. This organization has members in 49 states, from many provinces in Canada and such other countries as Mexico, England, France, Spain, Lebanon, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia.The general public is invited to attend.Anyone interested in game bird propagation, improved wildlife habitat, improved hunting and outdoor recreational opportunities is cordially invited. NAGB&amp;amp;SPA's meetings and short courses are attended by some of the most knowledgable and experienced people in upland game bird and waterfowl propagation. In addition to the private game farms, hunting resorts and outdoor recreation enterprises, there will be representatives of many State Conservation Departments, State Game Farms, State Universities, the U.S. Bureau of Sports Fisheries &amp;amp; Wildlife, National Rifle Association, National Shooting Sports Foundation and several Conservation Organizations, including the Izaac Walton League.Each year there is increased interest and increased need for the cooperation of private-enterprise in improved hunting, conservation and outdoor recreation. Even though PUBLIC lands, PUBLIC parks and PUBLIC HUNTING AREAS GET MOST OF THE PUBLICITY, the fact remains that 80% of the land in this Nation is privately-owned. Modern technology, developments and CLEAN FARMING, leave very little cover for game.The combination of too little public land, the shortage of adequate wildlife and the resulting shortage of game and hunting areas near the centers of population, have pushed the private-enterprise game farm and hunting &amp;amp; conservation areas into nationwide popularity and remarkable growth. Thousands of game farms produce game birds for legal sale to anyone wishing to purchase them. Almost 3,200 private hunting &amp;amp; conservation preserves provide tailor-made wildlife habitat for both game species and non-game species. They continuously restock the areas with full-feathered, hardflying game birds. Because they provide their own land, plant their own wildlife habitat and stock their own game birds, these hunting preserves are licensed by the State Conservation Departments to provide extended seasons for hunting. They provide "bag limits" set by the individual hunter who is willing to support such conservation practices.The American sportsman is finally realizing that he's not living in the days of Daniel Boone. The true sportsman is getting over the erronious, prejudicial assumption that MOTHER NATURE is obligated to furnish all his recreational demands. He's getting over the idea of harvesting a crop he's had no part in producing. The good sportsman is now realizing that not everyone can harvest that crop on someone else's land. The good sportsman is happy to support his own improved hunting area that he helps develop into a Conservation Showcase. They're proud to be a part of such a worthwhile, self-supporting movement in improved hunting, conservation and healthy outdoor recreation.All interested persons are invited to the Missouri Convention, Jan. 8-12, 1979.
