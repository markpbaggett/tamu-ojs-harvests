Many birds have been so honored, but until recently no parrots.On November 3, 1978 Great Britain gave independence to one of her island possessions of the Lesser Antilles in the Carib bean- Dominica.This island is the home of two threatened Amazon parrots, the rednecked Amazon (A. arausiaca) and perhaps the emperor of all parrots, the imperial Amazon (A. imperialis).Few have ever seen the imperial Amazon, a magnificent eighteen to twenty inch bird with mainly maroon, purple and green hues, which resides on the higher slopes of the mountain Morne Diablotin. The inaccessability of its haunts has aided the imperial Amazon to a considerable degree, although in 1977 the population estimates for the imperial Amazon was only 150 individuals. As true with all monarchs, it is vulnerable in these modern times. The lumber industry is perhaps its greatest threat, but the people and government of Dominica have emblazoned this noble bird on their national banner for all the world to see, elevating a...</dc:description>
