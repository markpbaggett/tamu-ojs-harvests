	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Nunez today announced that a Federal Grand Jury sitting in San Diego has returned a three-count indictment against a Bell, California pet store owner and a Tijuana, Mexico businessman for their role in a scheme to smuggle approximately $25,000 worth of exotic parrots into the United States from Mexico. Mr. Nunez stated that Virginia Vidrio, the owner and manager of a retail pet shop in Bell, California known as "Vicky's Pet Shop" at 4249 East Florence Avenue, Bell, California, and Mario Navarro, a resident of Tijuana, Mexico, were charged with smuggling 20 baby yellow-naped Amazon parrots and three military macaws into the United States from Mexico on February 15, 1987. Mr. Nunez continued that the pair were also charged with conspiracy respecting the smuggled birds. </dc:description>
