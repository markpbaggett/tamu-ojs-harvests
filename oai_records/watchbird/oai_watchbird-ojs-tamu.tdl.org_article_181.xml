	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A common practice by serious canarybreeders is to band their birds. Severaladvantages will result from the practice.First of all it is the only way of keepingeffective records. "Closed" bands (rings)have the year of bird inscribed on thering, and as they cannot be placed orremoved after a certain age, they are aguarantee of the birds age. Other informationinscribed on the band is a serialnumber and initials of your club or aspecialist society you purchase the bandfrom. Records are kept by the club in regardto whom particular numbers are sold,therefore these bands become traceable.A form of pedigree record keeping isachieved when you buy the rings fromthe club or a specialist society. Theseclosed rings are made of aluminum andeach year the color is diffierent, thereforeyou can tell the age of the bird froma distance_ For example the color for1976 is blue, for 1975 was red, for 1974was green.</dc:description>
