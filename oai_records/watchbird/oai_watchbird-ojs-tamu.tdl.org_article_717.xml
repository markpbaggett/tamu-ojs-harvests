	<dc:description xml:lang="en">People, including your humble servant,are creatures of habit and accustomedto routine. My troubles beganwhen I left my downtown Los Angeleshome to attend the AFA's 19th AnnualConvention in Salt Lake City, Utah.As the plane crested the ring ofjagged mountains and dipped into theGreat Salt Lake Valley, I knew somethingwas wrong. The sky was blue.Really blue blue, with a scattering ofsnow white clouds. The air was crystalclear.When I debarked and tried tobreathe, I panicked. I couldn't see theair nor feel it. Perhaps Utah doesn 'thave air. I'll die.Well, I didn't die but the invisible airwas not easy to get used to. Fortunately,the van from the hotel arrivedand took us aboard. On the plane, mytravelling companio ns had banishedme to a distant seat and asked me toact as though we didn 't know oneanother- they do this routinely -but the van was small and cozyenough that we three , Aletta Long,Jean Hessler and myself, arrived at theconvention as a group. The others onÂ group- naturally.The Little America Hotel, I mustadmit, was a very pleasant and comfortableplace to stay. The ambiencewas a mixture of comfott and modestluxury situated in an almost park-likeenvironment. It was a very enjoyableexperience to walk about the groundsamidst the intense colors, greens andblues for the trees (yes, folks, bluetrees) and the brilliant red, yellow andpink of the flowers . And an unlookedfor blessing was that of being able tomeander freely about the grounds andsu rrounding neighborhood without athought of getting mugged or havingto dodge the drive-by shooters. Capitalfolks , those denizens of Utah.Inside the hotel , a friendly, homeyatmosphere prevailed and promoted arelaxed sense of ease and comfort.The convention meeting rooms, largeauditorium , banquet hall and commercialdisplays were very convenientlylaid out in close proximity sothat it was quite easy to get fromattraction to attraction.</dc:description>
