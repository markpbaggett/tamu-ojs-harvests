	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the previous issue of the Watchbird we reported on successful breedings of Purple Grenadiers by aviculturists in Florida and California. Both those efforts utilized fostering: the birds were raised by Society finches.In Chicago. Alex Keylard raised seven Purple Grenadiers under their natural parents in an indoor aviary 40 by 70 feet by l O feet high. The flight is heavily planted and contains about 150 finches, including six pairs of Grenadiers. "It's like having them in the wild ." he says.He got his birds four or five years ago, but says only in the past few years have several of the pair raised young ... The parents." he reports. "eat a lot of insect food while raising them, .. and invade wide-wired macaw cages within the huge flight to eat com fed on cobs to the hookbills. He believes the parents feed thi~ to their young. Banana peels are kept in the flight to produce fruit flies. The Grenadiers have nested in bushes and 111 the rafters of the building.Â </dc:description>
