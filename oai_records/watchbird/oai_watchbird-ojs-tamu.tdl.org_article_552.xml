	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Aviculturea Winner atCITES MeetingMost aviculturists expected the worst from the 8th Conferenceof the Parties to CITES, the Convention on InternationalTrade in Endangered Species, which was held in Kyoto, Japanin early March. After the last meeting in Switzerland in 1989,animal rights groups vowed to push for a total ban on trade inall wild-caught birds. Fortunately for AFA members, nearly allof the resolutions in Kyoto that would have seriously curtailedbird-keeping were defeated. This outcome did not reflectwidespread support for captive breeding of birds, but rathercame from a general attitude favoring sustainable utilizationinstead of strict preservation of wildlife. Serious concerns stillremain about the high mortality associated with transport ofwild-caught birds and will no doubt lead to renewed calls fortrade restrictions and bans at the next CITES meeting to beheld in the United States in 1994.AFA, one of over 150 non-government organizations(NGOs) in Kyoto, was represented by Val Clear and myself.There is an unwritten but definite caste system in effect atCITES meetings. Delegates from the richest nations and membersof the CITES Secretariat (the bureaucracy that enforcesthe treaty) are at the top of the pyramid, representatives fromless-developed countries and from large international NGOssuch as World Wildlife Fund (WWF) come next, and relativelysmall groups perceived as representing special interests, suchas AFA, are at the bottom. Seniority also plays a role: the moreprevious CITES meetings you have attended, the more you arelistened to. Despite this arrangement, it is possible for representativesof a small NGO to have some influence by talkingone-on-one with individual delegates and by becoming alliedwith better-known groups.</dc:description>
