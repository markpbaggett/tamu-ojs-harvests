	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Kingfishers and Related Birds are a truly monumental ornithological and art work due not only to its complete and highly informative scientific text and superb illustrations but also its exceptional presentation. This three part, six volume work has presently been issued only as a limited edition of 1,000 copies for worldwide distribution. Its price is high. This situation is expected to change within the next few years, however, with the publication of a trade edition.The reformatting for the trade edition has already been largely completed by Mr. Forshaw. The author of this sumptuous work is the world renowned ornithologist Joseph M. Forshaw. The illustrator is internationally acclaimed natural history artist William T. Cooper. Mr. Cooper is acknowledged as one of the world's leading painters of birds. Work on this enormous project was commenced in 1978. The first volume was published in 1983 with the announced expectation of one volume per year thereafter to completion.</dc:description>
