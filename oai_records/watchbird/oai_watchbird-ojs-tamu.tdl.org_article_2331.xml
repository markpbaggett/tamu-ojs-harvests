	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This service is to match unmated birds, to bring joy to forlorn single birds and their discouraged owners, and to broaden the gene pool in needy species.To list a bird give as much of the following as you can: English name or names by which it is known, Latin name and sex; your name, address and phone number; one dollar for up to four birds.To answer a listing send a separate letter for each bird sought (each one goes to a different source), including your name, address and phone number; enclose a dollar for each bird sought (to cover mailing your response).No responsibility whatever can be accepted by the Media Committee, Watchbird or the American Federation of Aviculture for transactions entered into as a result of this service. All persons' names will be kept strictly confidential. Receipts above expenses go to the AFA treasury for appropriate uses.
