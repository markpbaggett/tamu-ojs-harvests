	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Before beginning this article on theMasked Love Bird, it is with pride thatI announce the hatching of a new birdto American Aviculture. I have beenfortunate to raise the first Albino Pe achFace Love Bird. The bird is in excellenthealth, and it is pale lemon yellow incolor as anticipated, not pure white (cf.A.F.A. Watchbird Vol. Il urn. 5 pg. 13).The parentage itself is the most interestingpart of the story. The father, agreen/albino (i.e. split both blue andLutino) is mated to another hen in acolony of Blue Birds (approximately11 pairs). An explanation is difficult,however' r am sure all of us have hadsome similar experience. The male, asfar as I knew , was mated to a blue hen inthe aviary. In their first nest she hatchedtwo green birds and a red eyed bird thatdied in the shell. This bird would havebeen Albino, if it had lived, since it hadwhite down. The hen was sitting on a newclutch of eggs when I noticed in a nestbox on the other wall of the aviary a newhatching. The blue hen in this box hadas I now realize, also mated to the green/Albino male and it is from her that wehatched three babies, an Albino, a Lutinoand a Blue.</dc:description>
