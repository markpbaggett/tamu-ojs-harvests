	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Present day zoos and private breeders face the task of establishing and maintaining multigeneration, self-reproducing populations of captive wild species. In some instances these captive populations provide the only reservoir for species on the verge of extinction or already extinct in the wild. The greatly reduced availability of wild birds has resulted in an increased interest in sustained captive breeding programs. Considering that perhaps 700-800 species of wild birds are being bred in captivity and that these are dispersed among perhaps 10,000 or more breeders, and that replacements are increasingly difficult to obtain, then there is an obvious need for minimum record keeping standards and a means of pooling, collating and sharing basic data for captive population management of each species or. subspecies. This is a challenge with high stakes including the complete loss of species when they become extinct in the wild.The International Species Inventory System (ISIS) was initiated by the AAZPA and AAZV in 1974 to collect, analyze and disseminate in a usable form, census and vital statistics data on wild species held in captivity. Such data are considered essential if the hazards of fortuitous losses of species and of loss of genetic variability are to be avoided in working with dispersed, small captive populations. The ISIS program provides a convenient and participant - oriented record system designed for manual and computer use. The reports are designed to provide useful information for local management as well as interesting biological information on the species.Participants are provided annually with three reports. The participant Inventory Report is a complete and detailed listing by species of the inventory of the individual participant. The Acquisition/Release Report is a similarly arranged report itemizing all changes in the collection during the year. The ISIS Species Distribution Report is a summary by species of all specimens recorded in ISIS and provides an overall picture of the status of the species in captivity. All participants holding a given species and the age and sex composition of their holdings are listed, followed by tables on age and sex structure, mortality, births, and other acquisition and release information. Similar summaries are provided at the level of genus, family, and order. The report for 1977 was 2,400 pages long and is provided in its entirety only in microfiche. Individual portions are available in hard copy.Participants are also provided with a set of directories. The ISIS Institution Procedures describes the methods for recording and submitting data to ISIS. The ISIS World Geographic and Zoological Institution Directory provides a hierarchical listing of geopolitical divisions of the world, including a listing of organizations and individuals holding wild animals in captivity. The ISIS Avian Taxonomic Directories use a hierarchical taxonomic coding system assigning unique members to each taxonomic grouping.Data is submitted for each individual animal on forms provided by ISIS (figure 1 ). The data reported include species and participant identification, identification numbers of parents (if known), and source of the animal if not born in the collection. A form is also completed when the animal is removed from the collection, whatever the cause - whether sale, donation or death. If sent elsewhere, this is indicated so that a linkage is provided for tracing the animal throughout its life.The census and vital statistics data system described has been operational for mammals for three years and was expanded to include the birds in 1976. As of the end of 1977 ISIS had information on 13,172 living birds, 1,577 live hatchings and 1,226 deaths. It is anticipated that information on approximately 30,000 birds will be included by the end of 1978.  </dc:description>
