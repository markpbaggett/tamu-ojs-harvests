	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Spectacular! That is the best wordto describe the unique and beautifulcollection of birds housed in theSchmidt aviaries. With over seventyspecies of softbills, including nineteenspecies of fruit doves, it is one ofthe best of its kind in north America.Species virtually never before seen inAmerican collections, such as Malaysiancrested jays, long tailed broadbills,and spangled cotingas, arehoused in spacious, planted flights,set in the tropical climate of Tampa,Florida.Richard Schmidt, with the help ofhis wife Mary Jo, has carefully puttogether a breeding program thatshould assure the availability of anumber of beautiful birds for thediscerning aviculturist. Located on aformer commercial cockatiel farmeast of Tampa, the Schmidts have twoacres to develop and progress isunderway. A number of flights havebeen put together, en bane, surroundinga central aviary and work space.Radiating outward, the numerousflights, nearly twenty feet in length,contain mixed species in some cases,and single pairs in others. Severalpairs of touracos are housed in oneend of the complex, a single pair to aflight, while in other areas, species of. thrushes, cotingas, and others may behoused together. Most of the flightsare heavily planted, affording securityfor the birds in a natural setting that isquite pleasing to the eye.</dc:description>
