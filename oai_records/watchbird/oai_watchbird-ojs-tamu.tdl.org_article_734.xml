	<dc:description xml:lang="en">What do you do when you have athree week old baby Amboina KingParrot and need to be gone fromhome for three days to put on anantique motorcycle show? None ofyour friends who can hand feed wantto take the responsibility for a bird soyoung. Well, you take the bird alongwith you, by golly! In the process, hedoes well , gets a great name, and Ilearned a lot about improvising.I had Merkel for five days before theshow, and was taking him to workwith me for his daytime feedings . Hewas already in a double box situationwith a heating pad . Merkel is anArnboina King Parrot which species isexceptionally easy to hand feed anddeal with even at two weeks old. Forthe work situation, I put his "babycradle" box, which was about 8" x12", into a larger box, about 18" x 24",with a heating pad on low, under his"cradle box." The remaining room inthe larger box was used to transporthis formula , teaspoon, thermometer,feeding syringe, extra towels, and tissuesfor wiping his chin. I happen tolike tea towels as opposed to shavingsfor use under my baby birds , andchange them often. At work, we arelucky enough to have a microwaveoven, making formula heating easy.Suddenly, Friday was upon us, and Ihad no takers for baby bird sitting. Igot creative in a huny! Grabbed a twofoot high stack of towels, a large plasticbag to serve as a "diaper pail," enough food for him, but forgot tobring a jug of purified water. So guesswhat? I used our bottled water wedrink - the fancy stuff, with picturesof Alpine mountain peaks on thelabels. That's got to be good water tomix with hand feeding formula! Buthow would I heat water for him in acamping situation at the fair groundsin Hanford? I bought what is called a"stinger" at the variety store. About $7.00, it is a coil that heats up, on acord, when plugged into an electricoutlet. Perfect, because I always use aglass candy thermometer to make sureof the temperature before feeding,anyhow.Merkel traveled well the three hoursit took us to get to our destination,right beside me on the seat, where Icould keep an eye on him. By the timewe got there, it was already dark andtime for bed. I found a power sourceand plugged his heating pad in onmedium for the night. He needed hislast feeding so I put the stinger in a littlewater in the bottom of a cup.Apparently I didn't leave it in longenough and had put the powderedformula in already, so when I put thestinger back in to get it hotter, lots offormula baked on the coil part. It wasmessy and wouldn't come off readily.I quickly learned how hot to get thewater, then take the coil out, beforeadding the powder. Maybe even overheatthe water. It only takes a fewminutes to cool down to feedingtemperature outdoors.Because it was early May and theevening was mild, I slept on theground under the stars with Merkelright beside my head so I'd hear him ifhe stirred. I put a light cotton towelover his box to retain the heat for him.We slept very comfortably; however,one of my friends who was patrollingthe show bike area that night reportedthat two cats were within a few feet ofus at one point during the night. I wasglad I had Merkel so close to me. Thatwould have been an expensive mealfor two undeserving stray cats!Short term baby sitters to keep aneye on him were plentiful andwatched him faithfully when I had tobe off taking photos, etc. I fed him onhis regular schedule, and it was reallyonly a little more trouble than athome. As the day warmed up, I turnedthe heating pad off and kept him inthe shade. He became a little overwarmin the late afternoon and Inoticed he didn't eat quite as enthusiasticallyfor the latter half of the day,either. I fed him smaller amounts andoftener during this time, and I madethe consistency of his food morewatery, figuring it would slide downbetter. He probably needed moremoisture, anyhow. I took him out ofhis box occasionally so the air couldcirculate around him. We even took awalk around the swap area of old motorcycles, Merkel and I, being carefulto stay in the shade when wecould.</dc:description>
