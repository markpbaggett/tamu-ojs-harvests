	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A zoo keeper in charge of morning nectar feeding had no sooner begun the task in the lorikeet enclosure, when he noticed an extra buzz of excitement. A pair of Rainbow Lorikeets were enthusiastically jabbering and frog-hopping around outside on top of the cage! It seems they had burrowed their way through the grassy turf under the base of the aviary wire and were blissfully flying free."Oh, oh!" thought the worker, and promptly called staff superiors. A capture party was organized and a net was brought out.Well, those two Trichoglossus took one look at that net and immediately flew across the lake! That was that for the zoo staff; no catching them now.Late the same afternoon, the avian exhibit employees were summoned to an entertaining commotion outside the concession stand. Two thoroughly captivating Rainbow Lorikeets were eagerly bouncing from shoulder to dixie cup sampling a "gourmet" luncheon of ice cream and treats. It was a simple matter for the lory keepers to go over and retrieve the escapees.  </dc:description>
