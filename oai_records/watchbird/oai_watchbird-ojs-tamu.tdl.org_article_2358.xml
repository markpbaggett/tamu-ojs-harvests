	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Association of Avian Veterinarians is an international organization committed to improving the welfare of avian species through advancing knowledge of captive bird medicine and surgery. Established in 1980, it is the largest veterinary specialty group in the United States. The Association membership is comprised of veterinarians from private practice, zoos, universities and industry as well as students, aviculcurists and allied personnel.The A.AV sponsors an annual scientific conference which provides a forum for leading avian practitioners and researchers to present new clinical procedures and advances in avian medicine.In addition, the A.AV cooperates in providing speakers for avian education programs for the American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Animal Hospital Association, the Eastern and Western States Veterinary Conferences, the American Federation of Aviculture and a variety of local veterinary meetings.The Association, in striving to advance medical knowledge of captive birds, has established a research fund and is committed to funding projects that will directly benefit avian species. Grants are awarded yearly at the annual conference.The A.A.V. publishes a quarterly newsletter which provides an informal format for the exchange of avian practice tips, case reports, news items, reviews of lectures from avian seminars and announcements of continuing education programs. The Newsletter is donated to veterinary school libraries.Proceedings are published and distributed in conjunction with each Annual Seminar. Over 400 people attended the Sixth Annual Meeting which was held recently in Boulder, Colorado.Scientific papers were presented on a variety of topics including avian sex determination, use of isoflurane anesthesia in birds and hypocalcemia syndrome in African greys. Highlighting this year's program was a half-day seminar devoted to Chlamydios is (Psittacosis) and a Basic Avian Medicine Symposium for the beginning avian practitioner.By action of the Executive Board, a scholarship fund was established this year to assist veterinary students interested in avian medicine.Grants totaling Sl5,000 were awarded for the following research projects: "An ELISA Assay for Detecting Aspergillosis in Avian Species'' (Dr. Pat Redig); "Studies on the Efficacy of Peroxidase-Anti-peroxidase Technique in the Diagnosis of Chlamydiosis in Birds" (Dr. Francis Moore) and "Diagnostic Criteria for the Evaluation of Protein Malnutrition and Obesity in the Budgerigar" (Dr. Patricia O'Handley and Dr. Donald Polin).Awarded lifetime honorary membership for his contribution to avian medicine was Dr. Roland Winterfield of Purdue University.Officers elected for 1985-1986 were:President Dr. R. Dean Axelson (Willowdale, Ontario, Canada); Vice President Dr. Dave McCluggage (Brighton, Colorado); Secretary Dr. Gloria Goodman (Langhorne, Pennsylvania); and Treasurer Dr. Robert B.
