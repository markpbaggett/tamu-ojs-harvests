	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Today I becameacquainted withthe owners of aneighborhood petshop. They hadcome to my hometo see our aviaries.As their time waslimited our conversationwasbrief, however themost salient partof our conve rsationwhich re-mained with me, was their statement,"the retail pet dealers should support thehobbiest pet breeder. Without them thepet stores will surely have difficul ties ."This is so true. All concerned must supporteach other. We cannot survive alone.There are many well financed conservationorganizations which are lobbying andexerting extreme pressure, at both theFederal and State level, to prevent petsfrom being owned, bred, bought and sold,and/or transported.</dc:description>
