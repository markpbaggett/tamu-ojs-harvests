	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tony Silva is starting work on the companion volume to his A Monograh of Endangered Parrots. This new book, entitled A Monograph of Macaws and Conures, will be illustrated by Eric Peake. It will cover each species and subspecies of macaw and conure in field and aviary. The format will follow the first monograph, but will be much more expanded and will contain sonograms. Aviculturists are urged to send details of their breedings for inclusion. Of particular interest would be details on the growth rate of young, the number bred and year, diet fed, cage and nesting box sizes and any other information that may be considered important. Those persons with field experience are also urged to send information; of special interest would be reports of sightings, habitat type and locality.The idea is to produce as complete a work as possible. Proper credit would, of course, be given.Information should be sent to:Tony Silva, Curator of Birds, Loro Parque S.A., 38400 Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain.• </dc:description>
