	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Quaker Parakeet Society (QPS) was founded in 1999. It is a growing group of pet owners and aviculturists who care about and wish to preserve all Quaker Parakeets Myiopsitta monachus both captive and feral. It is dedicated to the following goals:• To support the responsible breeding and keeping of Quaker Parakeets;• To educate on the care and habits of Quaker Parakeets in the home, in the aviary, and in the wild; • To promote the survival and humane treatment of Quaker Parakeets in all environments and habitats.The Quaker Parakeet Society publishes a quarterly magazine, The Sentinel. Its purpose is to share stories and information on care and behavior of Quakers, as well as to keep the membership updated on what is happening within the various subcommittees. There is a core group of contributors with regular columns on advice for pet owners, surveys, classifieds, and special articles. Other well known writers in the Quaker community contribute periodically. QPS has established QPS/RAPP - Quaker Parakeet Society Rescue and Placement Program. It is solely internet based and focused on Quakers. In this group are over 100 volunteers across the country that give their time to transport, foster, and adopt Quaker Parakeets at need. Since the inception of the group, 77 Quakers have been accepted by RAPP.To meet the educational needs of Quaker owners, QPS/RAPP established RAPPbaac (Rescue And Placement Program, before and after care), which is a mentoring program and two web-sites. It is a successful program that has allowed many Quakers to stay with their original owners.Another issue that impacts RAPP is that Quakers are currently illegal to own in approximately 12 states (the number varies as legislation and state regulations change).Many of these states will confiscate a Quaker if found and euthanize it. RAPP has agreements with the Pennsylvania and Connecticut Departments of Fish and Wildlife to be called if a Quaker is confiscated in those states. Volunteers from neighboring states are brought in to take the birds out of state and into foster homes. At no time are any of the RAPP rescued birds put into breeder situations unless requested by the relinquishing owner. RAPP is currently working to educate potential Quaker owners prior to purchase.  </dc:description>
