	<dc:description xml:lang="en">FINAL REPORT for 2013PROJECT: To identify damage to corn plantings by Lear's macaws in 2013SUB-PROJECT: The evaluation of damages to affected corn fields, and estimates of replacement value for the local farmers.1. PROJECTThe objective of the Project is to compensate for the damages caused by Lear's macaws to corn fields in Brazil. The project aims to lessen, to the minimum extent possible, the negative effects of systematic attacks by Lear's macaws in diverse rural communities located in the municipalities of the Ecoregion of the Raso da Catarina, Bahia State, Brazil. At the same time it is also the objective to reduce the formation of a negative image of these birds among the rural population in light of the increased incidence of damages to the farmers, which has contributed to the negative image of the birds as pests due to damages to their corn fields.The Sub-project: The Evaluation of Damages and Estimates of Harm Done to the Fields, developed in partnership with Parrots International, Lymington Foundation, Nutr6pica, The Parrot Society UK, Phoenix Landing, The American Federation of Aviculture, Inc., The Parrot Fund/ Amigos de las Aves USA, and ECO, carried out hands-on measurement of damages and consequent estimates of harm to the damaged fields and at the same time hosted activities destined to promote environmental awareness of the farmers in the rural communities affected by the attacks.Unfortunately, the high level of human pressure on the natural resources in the region has heavily contributed to conflicts between the local populations and native fauna, especially the Lear's macaw. Thus, in spite of efforts to mitigate the serious problem, it has worsened. The situation has become more critical because of the high growth rate of the Lear's macaw population in recent years, and their growing reliance on the supply of cultivated vegetables and other resources which have become more and more desired due to the destruction of the native Caatinga vegetation.This bad situation points out the importance and urgency of the development of effective actions to increase the supply of food resources for the native fauna of the region. Instead, what is happening is a definite increasing trend in conflicts each year. Moreover, it is necessary that the inhabitants of these areas become more aware of the importance of sustainable use of the native vegetation and development of a life style living in harmony with the environment in this semi-arid climate, a lifestyle that contributes to the conservation of the Caatinga Biome. </dc:description>
