	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I have many happy memorieswhen it comes to showing birds as ajunior member of a bird club andmany of these memories are clue tothe support of the adult members ofthe local club at the time.I must have been about 13 yearsold when the first bird I had evershown was an English Fantail pigeonand, as this was not a quality bird, itwon no prizes. But it wasn't longbefore I was introduced further tothe world of showing birds by theadult members of the local club. Thememory of their attentiveness andinterest to my best friend , my sister,Â along with myself, and on occasion afew of our other friends, in helpingus grow and learn more about birds isstill with me today.</dc:description>
