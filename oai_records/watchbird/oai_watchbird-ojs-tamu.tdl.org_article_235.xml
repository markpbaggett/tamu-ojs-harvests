	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dear EditorI am very much interested in RedCrestedCardinals (Paroaria coronata) andenjoyed the article by Mr. Chris LaRuevery much [Watchbird, Vol. III, No.4,Aug/Sept 1976]. I cannot think why Mr.LaRue failed to describe the Red-CrestedCardinal hen, however. I too, Mr. LaRue,am somewhat disappointed with the"Watchbird"; you with the ridiculouscover and I with your failure to attemptto describe the hen.Another point of contention. I'd liketo point out to Mr. Gerald Moore thatfor many years aviculturists around theworld wanted to get their hands on thescientists who are naming the birds. Mr.Rae Anderson told me that when hisGould Finch article was written, theproper scientific name for the bird wasPoephila gouldiae rather than Chloebia. Iwould like to find out where you, Mr.Moore, came by the knowledge of the"new" scientific name for the Gouldians.The bird was named by its discover,John Gould. He named it after his wife.Was Gould right or wrong?E. NecekLos Angeles, CA.</dc:description>
