The fourth eggproved to be infertile.The chicks were pulled for handrearing at 4, 1 and 4 days oldrespectively. This precaution was taken since the previous yearthree chicks had hatched successfully but then all diedmysteriously after nearly a month with the parents.Currently, the chicks are fully weaned and fledged and aredoing just fine. Their first years will be spent educating theisland population of the plight of their own endangered parrotspecies. As they reach maturity though, plans are in the worksto pair them up with wild-caught stock from their native islandof Great Inagua.This is the first time in the world that Bahama Parrots haveever been successfully handraised. Also, to our knowledge,this is the world's only captive breeding pair of BahamaParrots.•</dc:description>
