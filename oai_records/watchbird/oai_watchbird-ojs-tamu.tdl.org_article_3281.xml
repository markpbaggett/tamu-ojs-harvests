	<dc:description xml:lang="en">LoryLeague.orgis excited to announce the bird show, in conjunction with the 2012 AFA Convention, and has been awarded a Double Point Show Status.There will be two shows this year in the same room. One will take place in the morning with Jim Heffernan as our judge, and the one in the afternoon with Linda Rubin as judge; this will be the double point show. Winners in the second show will receive double the amount of points for placing on the top bench.We are also pleased to announce we will have a Junior Division in both shows this year. Junior Division is for individuals 16 and younger who wish to join the fun of showing their birds. In the Junior Division, children can show their pet birds, and are not discounted points for clipped wings. This is the same as in the Novice Division.We will be awarding lots of ribbons and awards at the show, including the new medallion awards. Medallion awards will be given for the top three birds in each show, and to the top three birds in the Junior Division of each show.To add more to the fun, we will have awards for different categories:Audience Favorite, Oldest Bird, Most Unusual Species at show and Youngest Exhibitor.Remember that show cages are not required. All you need is a clean cage with a perch and food and water. No toys or decorations.Cage entry fee is $3 per bird with a cap of $25 for each show, so this is a great time to bring as many as you want with a reduced price for entering more than 8 birds in the shows.If you have any questions, contact Julie at blconnection@hotmail.com or call 206-772-1730 after 10 a.m. PST.Come join the fun, see lots of great looking birds, visit with their owners, and learn more about the species and showing from our Judges as they educate the...</dc:description>
