	<dc:description xml:lang="en">T his rare conure is Ognorthynchus icterotis or Yellow-eared Conure. An amazingly beautiful conure, this species was abundant in the early 1900s across the High Andes of Columbia and northern Ecuador. By the 1980s the population had undergone a catastrophic decline as large flocks started dwindling and disappearing al an alarming rate. By the mid- 1990s it was reduced to only two known surviving flocks - one in Ecuador, another in Columbia, together numbering fewer than 50 individuals.This rare conure isOgnorthynchus icterotis or Yelloweared Conure. An amazingly beautiful conure, this species was abundant in the early 1900s across the High Andes of Columbia and northern Ecuador. By the 1980s the population had undergone a catastrophic decline as large flocks started dwindling and disappearing at an alarming rate. By the mid-1990s it was reduced to only two known surviving flocks - one in Ecuador, another in Columbia, together numbering fewer than 50 individuals.In June of 1998 Proyecto Ognorthynchus was launched aimed at locating these flocks and studying the species. Searches and a poster campaign was begun. Farmers were asked to report any sightings. However, none could he found. All traces of this species had vanished; traditional haunts had been deforested or hunting had exterminated the last known birds. With no reports and not a single individual in captivity the worst was feared.The search was about to end when a local person having seen the campaign poster reported seeing the species in a remote region of Columbia. In April of 1999, with utter euphoria, a roost site was found with three flocks totaling 81 birds. No others have been found since.You can read and view pictures of this conure at the International Conure Association web-site at: http://www3.upatsix.com/ica/ Click on the Yellow-eared Conure in the index.The International Conure Association (ICA) has joined in an alliance with Loro Parque, the American Bird Conservancy, and the World Parrot Trust to raise funds to support the ongoing research and conservation program to save this bird from extinction. It is hanging by a narrow thread. A comprehensive program has been developed to educate the local people as to the status of this parrot and to expand its needed habitat. The wax palm that the Yellow-eared Conure (YEC) needs for nests and food is also an endangered species.We have speakers available with a slide show and video presentation for your local bird clubs. All the speakers need is travel expenses. In addition, Paul Salaman, director of the Yellow-eared Conure Program, will be speaking at the American Federation of Aviculture's annual convention in August in Houston.I know that the hearts of conure lovers are big. I am hoping that conure lovers will embrace the Yellow-eared Conure and help to make the salvation of this endangered species a fact. Since the discovery of the 81 YECs in April, 1999, they have been through a breeding season and the flock has increased to 110 individuals. But we have a long ways to go - come make the journey with us.    </dc:description>
