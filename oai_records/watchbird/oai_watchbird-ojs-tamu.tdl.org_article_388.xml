	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Few aviculturists have not heard of Dick and Maurine Schroeder, at least on the West Coast. Dick and Maurine have been AFA members since AFA's beginning in 1974 and have continuously supported the AFA throughout the years. They have attended nearly every AFA convention and many regional meetings, an activity they have both immensely enjoyed. "We have met many interesting people at each conference, where we look forward to seeing old friends and making  new ones," Dick says. "Not only do  you learn from the program, you learn ~ what others are doing to solve particu~ Jar problems,'' he adds. </dc:description>
