	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A Reflection of 1991:1991 was another successful yearfor AFA's Red Siskin Project. Both ourmember numbers and bird numbershave grown significantly since 1990(as seen in the graph).We have a total of 44 Red SiskinProject Breeders in the program as ofyear end 1991 . These breeders arefound in 19 different states and inTrinidad. The numbers of red siskinsin the program climbed by 55 birdssince the previous year. Currently,we have 142 red siskins registered inthe studbook and approx. 50% ofthese birds are owned by the AF A.The other siskins are owned by theindividual Siskin Project Breeders.In 1991, many Siskin Project Breederswere given at least two pairs towork with. There wasn't a high rateof breeding success, as many of thebirds were young, and ideal conditionswere not present at many facilities.We are t aking a different strategyin 1992, where breeders aregiven three to four pairs. It is hopedthat the additional numbers of singingmales will stimulate breeding inÂ all females , and the siskins will feelmore at home. Standardized lightingconditions, etc. were given to thebreeders in 1992 to aid in breedingsuccess. We have already had reportsfrom a couple of breeders who havehatched baby siskins in 1992. It lookslike the 1992 breeding season promisesto be a good one for the Red SiskinProject!</dc:description>
