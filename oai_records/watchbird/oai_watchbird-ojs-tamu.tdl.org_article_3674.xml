	<dc:description xml:lang="en">U name is Kaylee and I am 7 years old.I went on a long trip from South Dakota to Seattle, Washington to go live with my Grandma &amp;amp; Grandpa, with my two little sisters in my Grandma's truck. We drove through the mountains and we saw lots of trees, flowers, grass, different flags and birds. It took 2 days and 2 nights to get there.When we got to my Grandma's I could hear birds, and when I asked Grandma if she had birds, She said yes, we have lots of them. They are all different kinds of parrots. I have never seen those kinds of birds before, only the wild birds outside.Grandma took me to where her birds are, so I could see them. Charlie, an African Grey said "Hi" to me. That was really cool Grandma also showed me how some of the birds can whistle.I liked the Macaws, my favorite are the big red ones; their names are Rosie and Ruby. They live together in a great big cage. Grandma says the big red macaws are called a Greenwing because of the color on their wings. Grandma asked them to lift their wings and they did. I could see all the feathers under their wings. One of them started to fly around. She has lots of other kinds of birds, they are different colors, some are big and some are little.I also met Stevie. He is green with purple and has black, he has an orange beak and has a really long tail almost like the macaws. Grandma says he is a parakeet, but everyone else says he is too big for a parakeet. Stevie is a Derbyan Parakeet, and Grandma showed me how he would take treats from her hand. I thought that was really cool. Grandma opened his cage, and he came right out on her arm. I think all of my Grandma's birds are pretty cool I have learned that I have to be careful because birds can bite and they could really hurt you if they want to. I learned that birds are very colorful, some birds talk or whistle, and when they lift their wings, the colors under their wings almost glitter. I also learned that macaws live a really long time. They can live to be 75 years old and maybe even older.Since I have come to live with my Grandma, I want to learn more about birds. I want to learn how to take care of them when I get older, I want to keep them. And another thing, they are called different species of birds, not just different kinds. I hope I will remember that.Another fun thing we did was go to Expos. I am learning all the bird's names and what kind of bird they are. Chinner is my most favorite at the expos, she is a Rose Breasted Cockatoo, and she is very pretty. I even got to hold her. So did my sisters, but they were on Grandma's lap because they are little. My sisters are only 3 and 1 years old I am 7 and I am bigger, so I got to hold her by myself on my arm.And I got to hold Bob. He is a gray Cockatiel and he is old. He is 28 years old. He does not like to be petted, but he sat on my hand. Bob and Chinner both have a crest.I really like Duvy, he is a brown bird with yellow feathers. He is a Duvyenbode Lory. Duvy is funny and likes everybody to pay attention to him. Gruff is another one I really like, she is a big green macaw. I think she is called a Military. Tanga is cute, she likes to jump on people's shoulder. She is red and she is a Lory, but she is called a Cardinal Lory. She has dark red and light red color on her feathers. </dc:description>
