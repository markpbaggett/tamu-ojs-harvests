	<dc:description xml:lang="en">For the past ten years, as supervisorof the Houston Zoo bird section, I havehad the opportunity of working with aremarkable group of birds- touracos.Touracos are a distinctive taxon ofsoftbilled birds which range over portionsof Africa, south of the Sahara.The Houston Zoo's breeding programfor touracos began in 1973 underthe direction of former curator RobertJ. Berry. Over the last 15 years the programhas expanded due to the teamefforts of former supervisor Trey Todd,myself, and an outstanding flock ofzookeepers. The program is ongoingand continues with present curatorLarry Shelton. The zoo currently holds80 touracos, representing 16 speciesand sub-species. Twenty-four areyoungsters raised since February of thisyear.Since 197 3 nearly 300 specimens,representing 12 species and subspecies,have been bred in Houston.During this period a great deal of experienceand information on touracos hasbeen amassed. Through communicationsbetween other zoos and privatebreeders interested in touracos, wecould easily see trends developingwith regard to the captive status ofthese species; once commonly bredspecies were decreasing, numericalover-representation of others wereapparent and genetic diversity in thecaptive population was becoming significantlyreduced.When the suggestion of a touracostudbook arose, these trends in thecaptive population could not be substantiatedbased on actual data and noreal determination could be made onwhich species were in greater need ofmanagement. Obviously, much moreinformation was required and with thisin mind I was given permission by thezoo director to initiate a touraco surveyquestionnaire on specimens in U.S.collections.</dc:description>
