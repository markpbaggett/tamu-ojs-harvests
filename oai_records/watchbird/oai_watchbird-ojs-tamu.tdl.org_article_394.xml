	<dc:description xml:lang="en">For the past three years we have had an exhibit at the California State Fair to help educate the general public along with adding a little money to our treasury. In 1987 the fair was from August 21 through September 7. Our club members staffed the exhibit for 12 hours a day. Our club has two AFA delegates, Sharon Garsee and Helen Caudle. We promoted AFA along with our club, NFS and NCS. We had demonstrations on several occasions throughout the run of the fair. The exhibit was organized by Bob and Jessie Abbott. More than 40 of our members took turns at shifts, some more than once. </dc:description>
