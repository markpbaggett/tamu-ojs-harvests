	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I have always been afraid of birds. Ithas to do with some infant trauma, mymother says. The only reason it cameup was because my sister arrived homeone day with a green parakeet namedPhillip. She let him out of the cage andwith the beating of the wings, my scalpbegan to crawl and I threw somethingover my head and ran from the room.Honestly, I wanted to like birds and Itried all sorts of home therapy. I wouldhold Phillip on my finger and strokehis feathers. This was nice, but whenhe flapped onto my shoulder or, worse,my head, I would panic.I finally decided the easiest thingwould be to avoid birds altogether.This was easy to do until I got married,had kids of my own, and was againunder pressure from my daughter, whoeven looks like my sister, to have a bird.Trying to explain my phobia, I toldmy family this was a real fear. Sorry butno birds, I said. I guess I must havebeen talking to the walls, because onmy daughter's sixth birthday my husbandappeared with a blue parakeetnamed Henry.</dc:description>
