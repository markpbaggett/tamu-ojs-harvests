	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Conservation. Venezuelan Black Hooded Red Siskin on the Brink</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Among other matters currently being considered by the AFA Conservation Committee, plans are being conceived to help ensure improved breeding success and more conscientious management of the Venezuelan black hooded red siskin (Carduelis cucullata) in captivity. The information presented here is intended to sharpen the awareness of readers, particularly those maintaining the species in their collections, as to the extreme vulnerability of the red siskin at the present time. A concerted effort on the part of aviculturists to develop and maintain a long-term, self-sustaining captive population of red siskins would certainly go a long way toward relieving pressures currently being placed on the few remaining wild populations. Without some sort of relief, the red siskin lies in imminent danger of extinction.The current status of the red siskin in the wild must be considered extremely critical, probably numbering as few as 600 to 800 individuals. Formerly, the species enjoyed a rather abundant, continuous natural distribution across the northern portion of Venezuela and northeastern Colombia, as well as isolated populations on the islands of Gasparee, Monos, and Trinidad. In addition to these, populations were established on Puerto Rico and Cuba, probably as a result of introductions or aviary escapes. The red siskin is now extremely rare throughout its range, last being recorded on Monos in 1894, on Gasparee in 1921, in Colombia in 1947, and on Trinidad in 1960. Its current status in Cuba is unknown.The few remaining wild populations of red siskins to be found in Venezuela are scattered in isolated pockets throughout the northwest and north central cordillera regions, where they are semi-nomadic, utilizing a wide range of habitat types. Even within their few remaining havens in Venezuela, they have been reduced in numbers so dramatically that, ironically, it is likely that the largest remaining single population of wild red siskins is now the introduced population on the island of Puerto Rico.When reading of similar declines in naturally occurring wild populations throughout the world, many reasons are frequently quoted as the probable cause for such declines. Rarely is the cause so obvious as in the case of the red siskin. The precipitous decline in wild populations of the red siskin has been directly attributed to its long-term exploitation by man, which, in turn, is linked to the species' long-standing popularity as a cagebird.Despite full protection by law on both the domestic level (within Venezuela) and on the international level, the species continues to lose ground at the hands of this exploitation, which dates back to the early 1800s.The species was first described to science by Swainson in 1820, and although it was unknown to the European cagebird trade during the 1800s, it was already being exported to the Canary Islands where it was soon to be hybridized with the canary. By the early 1900s it was commonly being hybridized with canaries in many countries, which led to the demonstration in 1928, that through these crosses, the long sought-after "red factor'' could be introduced into the domestic canary stock. These hybrids were not only colorful but retained the canary's size and song which placed them in great demand among canary fanciers.In the early decades of the 1900s, interest in cagebirds grew as did the international trade in exotic birds. As a result ofthe United States and many of the European countries enacting laws prohibiting capture and trade of native species of birds, interest was generated in the canary and its many varieties. Red factor canaries became especially popular, and because the red siskin was the only vehicle by which the red factor could be introduced, the demand for it skyrocketed. Unfortunately, at that time, the red siskin was not protected by law.As demand grew in the international market, their price rose abruptly, suddenly making them a lucrative target for bird trappers. Because of the species' rather limited geographical range and the predictability of its movements within that range, it was an easy target. The most commonly used method of trapping involved the use of a caged siskin, known as the "pitador.' whose purpose was to attract wild siskins with its calls. Around the caged pitador, perches, coated with sticky Ficus sap were arranged so that wild birds, responding to the calls of the pitador, would become stuck to the perches and hence be collected by the trappers. Many thousands of birds were collected in this manner, the majority of which died before ever reaching foreign markets.In the early decades of the 1900s, the red siskin was afforded some protection by the simple fact that the areas in which it is found, particularly its breeding grounds in the higher elevations, were largely inaccessible. Trappers were unable to collect from the beginning of the rainy season in March until after the breeding season in July. More recently, new roads into these areas allow trappers, equipped with allterrain vehicles, to follow the movements of the bird and collect virtually all year long. Even though the species is now so scarce that it cannot be collected in large numbers, the high price that they command continues to make them a highly sought-after prize.It wasn't until the early 1940s that the first steps were taken to afford the red siskin protection by law. It was during this period that Venezuelan ornithologists William Phelps, Sr. and Jr., became aware of the red siskin's increasing rarity and of its persecution at the hands of the bird trappers. It was largely because of their efforts that the wheels were set in motion, resulting in a series of laws designed to protect the red siskin.1944-1947-The Venezuelan Minesterio de Agricultura y Cria (MAC) adopted resolutions prohibiting sale and export of the red siskin, making it the first species ever to be protected by Venezuelan law.1952-The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) included the red siskin on its endangered species list.1975-The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) added the red siskin to its Appendix I, list of endangered species on July 1, 1975. CITES took effect for signatory parties in 1977.   </dc:description>
