	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Loro Parque Fundacion2009 Breeding ResultsAt the end of every breeding year, the balance is drawn up and evaluated, and the total breeding result for 2009 with 1,214 young parrots can be rated as an average breeding year. The highlights have certainly been the four young Lear's Macaws (Anodorhynchus leari), the Yellow-tailed Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus funereus), two Palm Cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus ), the Scaly-naped Amazon (Amazona mercenaria), two Yellow-crowned Amazons (Amazona ochrocephala xantholaema), three Red-spectacled Parrots (Amazona pretrei), four Pesquet's Parrots (Psittrichas fulgidus), the Short-tailed Parrot (Graydidascalus brachyurus), as well as two Mindanao Lorikeets (Trichoglossus johnstoniae), four Red-fronted Lorikeets(Charmosyna rubronotata), eight Gustav's Parakeets (Brotogeris cyanoptera gustavi) and the Thick-billed Parrot (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha).In the new year we have already been able to ring the first 18 parrot chicks. Besides some lovebirds (Agapornis), two Blue-crowned Lories (Vini australis) and two Rainbow Lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematodus capsitratus) were born.With our latest Loro Parque project, "Katandra Treetops," which has now been open for four months, we have learned many things. The Moluccan Cockatoos (Cacatua moluccensis) originally introduced into the aviary were great to observe, but they got too tame and confident with the visitors, so that one or another earring got snatched. Therefore we decided to take them out of the aviary and to replace them with some Major Mitchell's Cockatoos (Cacatua leadbeateri), which have adapted very quickly to their new environment, as well as being a real eye-catcher. Apart from the fact that the population of 120 birds is very stable, and there is an easy cohabitation of all the different species, for the visitors it is a great experience to see the parrots and other birds all together without any separating mesh or other barrier.33 Reasons to Attend the 7th Annual Parrot FestivalFrom Sept. 22-25, 2010, the 7th International Parrot Convention takes place in Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, Spain. The congress will be organized once again in its tried and tested form by the team of Loro Parque and the Loro Parque Fundaci6n, and is the top event worldwide for all parrot-lovers. Innumerable reasons exist for why you must not miss this event and some of them we have gathered for you here, dear reader:1. There is no better setting for a congress about parrots than the sunshine island Tenerife, with its sub-tropical beaches, palm groves and mountain forests.2. Parrot-lovers worldwide only get together like this once every four years.3. You can meet friends of the parrots from all over the world; at the previous Convention, participants from more than 40 countries attended.4. Nowhere is there a bigger parrot Convention than in Tenerife.5. Top speakers coming from all over the globe will present news and developments from the world of parrots.6. Participants will learn about the latest findings concerning parrots: protection of species, keeping, breeding, research and medicine.7. From these presentations you can take away practical tips for your own keeping and breeding of parrots.8. Convention presentations will be simultaneously translated into the German, English, Spanish and French, giving ample opportunity for participants to understand these.9. You can renew or establish valuable contacts with fellow parrot breeders from all around the world, which can have a positive effect on your own breeding population.10. The varied evening programme, with Cocktail reception, Beach Party, surprise Party and Gala Dinner is organized to provide a number of surprises.  </dc:description>
