	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The 1983 Watchbird photo contest entres were prominently displayed at this years' Chicago convention. Again, as in years before, a lot of fine photos were on review to the public.On Friday, August 19, judges deliberated and submitted their decisions. The judges were: M. Jean Hessler, Alena Long, Lee Horton, and Joe McLaughlin.Because of the heavy interest in baby birds and pet birds in domestic situations, new catagories were established in order to be fair to all entrees. The winners names were announced at the August 29th, Saturday evening banquet.Following is the complete winners list for all caragories, but only the winners in the color print, and black and white print caragories are shown in this issue. Next issue of Watch bird will feature the winning photos of the color slide catagory.Â </dc:description>
