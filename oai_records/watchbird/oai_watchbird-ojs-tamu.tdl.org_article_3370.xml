	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The sweet-natured conure family comprises 125 or so different species and subspecies. Conures have peaceful temperaments and, no wonder, thrive in large flocks. In captivity they quickly become accustomed to their keepers.Because of ' their fast and beautiful flight, it is wise to house them only in very large aviaries and large cages. The minimum measu rernents, we think, for an aviary should be 9 ft. x 71/z ft. x 9 ft.(3 m x 2'h m x 3m). An ideal night shelter measures 6ft. x 9 ft. x 9 ft. (2m x 3 m x 3 m). Because birds in general, and conures in particular, like to sleep at the highest possible level in an aviary or cage, the night shelter should be built a little taller than the flight or run. Such construction forces the birds to spend the night in A pair of colorful Nanday Conures. The sexes look alike. the shelter; this is especially important when cold weather arrives.The somewhat plumply built Nanday Conure, Nandayus nenda, measuring some 12 inches and with a weight of about 5 ounces, often has difficulty flying upward and also is rather helpless when on the ground. Its song, unfortunately, is loud and not pleasant to hear, and often is mere screaming. The bird is not too well suited for life in a town house or apartment, although some birds, given time, will quiet down.Our conures, hence also our Nandays, feed on fruit (pears, cherries, bananas, pineapples cut into small pieces, apples, and various berries), millet seed varieties, spray millet, some small (black) sunflower seeds, canary grass seed, oats, buckwheat, safflower, seeding grasses, cooked mung and other beans anی boiled corn,fresh vegetables, especially celery, green peas, beans, and strips of carrot, willow branches, cubes of hard cheese, and some live food, such as m e a l w o r m s , white worms, and ant pupae. The diet is supplemented with wheat bread soaked in water, well-cooked meat or eggs, cooked rice and pasta, unsweetened breakfast cereals and, as treats, bits of tofu, waterpacked tuna and unsweetened yogurt. Some of our birds will nibble on pellets and honey sticks. Soft food (commercially available) is always available, not only in the breeding season. </dc:description>
