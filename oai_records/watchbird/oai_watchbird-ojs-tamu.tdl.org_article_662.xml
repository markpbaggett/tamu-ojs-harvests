Once widespread on theislands, the robin, together with many other native birds, disappeared fromthe larger islands following Europeancolonization early last century.Forests and scrubland were cleared,and rats and cats introduced. Sevenbird species were exterminated.Miraculously however, a remnantBlack Robin population of about 20 to30 birds persisted for the subsequent90 years in five to seven hectares ofscrub forest on top of a 200 metresheer-sided rock stack - LittleMangere Island.Little Mangere is rarely visited, soextremely difficult is it to climb. However,in 1938 the late Sir Cha rlesFleming, Al an Wuthe rspoon andGraeme Turbott scaled the cliffs andrediscovered the Black Robin there. In the 1970s, the woody vegetationatop Little Mangere degenerated ra pidly.The robin population plummetedfrom 18 birds in 1973 to seven (twopairs and three males) in 1976, whenthe New Zealand Wildlife Service relocatedthe survivors on nearby 130 haMangere Island. Prior to this, 120,000trees had been planted on Mangere toprovide additional habitat for therobins and other native wildlife.(How the world 's most endangered birdwas saved from extinction)by Don MertonNew Zealand Department of ConservationEditor's Note: By 1980 only fiveChatham Island Black Robins -including just one effective breedingpair remained.

However,in 1938 the late Sir Cha rlesFleming, Al an Wuthe rspoon andGraeme Turbott scaled the cliffs andrediscovered the Black Robin there.During the final three years on LittleMangere, only one robin chick hadsurvived to breeding age. Althoughchick survival improved following thetransfer (five chicks in four years), theskewed age-structure of the populationmeant that recruitment of youngwas offset by natu ral mortality of oldbirds. Unaided, no rapid recovery waspossible and the species teetered onthe brink of extinction ; an urgentremedy was required.In common with some other NewZealand endemics, Black Robins tendto be long lived and to have a lowreproductive rate: the normal clutchsize is just two eggs and a successfulnesting cycle takes more than threemonths. Thus, the species lacks the ability to recover quickly when itspopulation is reduced. However,because Black Robins are capable ofrenesting, their potential productivityis greater. For this reason, in 1979when the species had declined to justfive birds, I proposed cross-fosteringas a means of capitalizing upon thispotential -to boost productivity andso quickly restore the population to aviable level.</dc:description>
