	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The majority of the Yellow-naped Amazon parrots being sold on the international market have been smug- gled from the south coast region of Guatemala. The wild populations of these birds are still being depleted by poaching because of the demand in the United States and Europe. Yellow- naped Amazons are one of the most popular psittacines in aviculture today. They cannot legally be exported from Guatemala and there are very few successful Yellow-NapedAmazon breeding programs in theStates. Whether due to carelessness,greed, ignorance or blind trust of theproprietor who claims they werehatched domestically, people are stillbuying smuggled napes. Consideringthe demand for these parrots and thepoverty and desperation of the Guatemalancampesino (native), it is easy tosee why Yellow-naped Amazons arestill disappearing from their nativehabitats and reappearing in livingrooms around the world.Young Yellow-naped Amazons aretaken from the nest in Guatemala tobe smuggled into Mexico and fromthere to the U.S. Tiny and still featherless,they are very fragile at this age. Itis estimated that they suffer losses of40 percent during capture and transportalone. The smuggler knows thisand compensates by buying five to tentimes more live chicks than theyexpect to sell. The World WildlifeFund study on international parrottrade estimates that 150,000 live parrotsenter the U.S. from Mexico eachyear. Considering the ones that dieduring capture and transport, thattranslates to about one million parrotstaken from the wild in Latin Americayearly. One wonders how long wildparrot populations can sustain themselves,suffering this degree of decimation.The Military Macaw (Arami/itaris), once a resident of the highlandsof Guatemala, has completelydisappeared in a relatively shortperiod of time. This is an example ofjust one species of bird that has disappearedfrom Guatemala.Despite the drastic reduction innumbers of Yellow-naped Amazons observed in their native coastal habitat in Guatemala in the past few years, they are still being smuggled out of the country in large numbers to meet the demand abroad. I have had the experience of seeing thousands ofYellow-naped Amazons on the borders of Mexico and Guatemala destined for the U.S. market for the past eight years. During this time I havebeenawitnesstothisreduction. The ScenarioChiquimulilla, Santa Rosa is 30 milesfrom the El Salvadoran border.December rolls around, marking theend of the rainy season, and there'snot much for the campesino to lookforward to. His corn and beans havebeen planted and harvested and henow searches for work to sustain himthrough the dry season. For some,working for the large land owners orcompanies will relieve some of theirfinancial burdens, while most willtighten their belts and wait for therains to return. Still other campesinoswill begin keeping a closer eye on thepaired Yellow-naped Amazons thatbegin their search for a suitable nestingsite. They're not difficult to findsince they tend to stake out certainterritories and the same nest year afteryear. Unfortunately, these days,Yellow-naped Amazons are oftenforced to seek new nesting sitesbecause their home tree was cut,many times by a novice poacher whoseeks to make a quick buck anddoesn't care if the pair returns.However, the experienced poacherknows that if he disturbs the nest aslittle as possible, the pair will returnthe following year or may evendouble clutch.And So The Harvest BeginsBird poachers have devised countlessways to rob a nest. It's dangerouswork climbing the tall trees with onlya thin nylon rope and a machete. Butempty stomachs and plenty of imaginationwill get the chicks out of thenest. From there, their future is uncertain.Once the poacher has the chicks,he wants to unload them as quickly aspossible. They are worthless dead andhe cannot afford to use his cornmealas bird food. There are options athand. The campesino can go directlyinto the larger cities along the southcoast and sell the chicks to the dealerin the central markets. These dealersare not hard to find. They are usuallydraped in gold jewelry and they selldomestic animals along with a myriadof odds and ends, all a cover for thethousands of endangered birds andother wildlife that pass through theirhands. The other option for thepoacher is to sit tight for the middleman to come directly to the source insearch of a better deal.There are several ways for the smugglerto bring the birds into the UnitedStates. Some birds are smuggled intoEl Salvador, where restrictions on birdsmuggling are not so strict. There theyare sold to nationals or to the "gringo"who buys birds for pets. They aresmuggled into the States by claimingtheir origins are from other countries.Others are laundered through Honduras,as Honduran Yellow-napes.They are a different subspecies, butare not too distinguishable from theGuatemalan species when young. Theeasiest and most common smugglingroute is through Mexico, a large countrywith as many ways to get the birdsinto the States as there are smugglersand imaginations.Tapachula, Mexico, in the State ofChiapas, is a large city on the pacificcoast bordering Guatemala. It hasnice, clean streets and handsome people... in general, very prosperous.One would never suspect this to be aplace where you can buy any kind ofexotic animal no matter how endangeredit is. This area is notroious forexotic bird trafficking if the price isright, and if you know where to look.And here is where I have been giventhe rare opportunity to see 1,500 babyYellow-nape chicks (as well as ScarletMacaws, howler and spider monkeys,baby jaguars and a slew of reptiles) inone person's home awaiting export tothe United States. This was no smalloperation and I was later to learn thata plane was coming in to fly theseanimals to Tijuana, Mexico.</dc:description>
