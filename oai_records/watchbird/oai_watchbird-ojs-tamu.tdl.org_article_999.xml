	<dc:description xml:lang="en">First, before I launch into my comments, I need for you to know that I have the most profound respect for aviculturists. I consider them a community of active, intelligent people who do what they love. Great things are being accomplished in a vi- culture, from educating school children to preserving species. They are being done by people with unparalleled devotion, people who know more about what they are doing than any- one else does. Aviculturists are truly experts at their jobs.My observation is that it is time for big changes in aviculture. Aviculture is at a critical juncture. Change is in the air. The right people to make these changes are the aviculturists them- selves. No one else cares more. No one else has the power to make it hap- pen. To me, this is the time for our community to set long range goals, and start outlining the steps required to reach them. We need to set high stan- dards for ourselves, for our aviaries and for our industry. We need to help each other to elevate standards.Take a moment to look at aviculture as an outsider. The condition of many of our facilities could be improved. We need to personally set goals for upgrading our management, making cleanliness, safety and the birds' well- being foremost in our plans. We have some wonderful guidelines to work from through the Model Aviculture Program (MAP). We all have a concept of the ideal facility. Perhaps we can't act on it right away, but we certainly can plan to make the next upgrade closer to that ideal, and strive for some worthwhile goals like MAP certifica- creattion.</dc:description>
