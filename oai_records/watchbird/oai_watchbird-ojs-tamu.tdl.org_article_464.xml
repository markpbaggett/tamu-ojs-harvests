	<dc:description xml:lang="en">When I graduated from highschool, my fiance gave me a beautifulpair of white doves. That was thestart of something great in more waysthan one! In the last 30 years we haveraised four children and lot of birds.We have kept a little bit of everything,except the big, noisy birds, aswe live in a residential neighborhoodand have always tried to respect that.After raising parakeets, cockatiels,lovebirds and five different kinds ofconures, we have found that our trueloves are finches, softbills and doves -especially fruit doves.Two years ago we acquired a pair ofblack naped fruit doves from ourfriend Richard Schmidt. We fell inlove with these beauties right off, andwere lucky enough to get them to goto nest and present us with a newbaby every few months.In the spring of '88, my husbandcame across four nondescript-lookingfruit doves. Having just been releasedfrom quarantine, they appeared to bein sad shape, but to us they were irresistable.Since the weather was stillcool and the birds looked less thanrobust, we kept them in a small cagein our quarantine area. At night weÂ provided them with a heat lamp.</dc:description>
