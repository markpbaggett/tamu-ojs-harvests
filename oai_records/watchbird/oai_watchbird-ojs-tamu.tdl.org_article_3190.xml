	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A new program was added to this year's convention, AFA4Kidz. The program is designed to introduce future generations to the fun and enjoyment ofbirds. Kids ages 6-14 learned about birds, shared what they knew, and participated in a fun environment. Adults who participated agreed it was a fun too. Of course the big magic was when the birds joined the group to the delight of all.THANK YOU TO OUR ADULT HELPERS Andrew Cook, Washington State coordinator Ginny Heptig, Central Florida state coordinatorTerri Jones, New Jersey state coordinatorPEOPLE WHO DONATED PRIZESJulie Corwin, NW regional director, youth program chairwomanJason Crean, Mideastern regional director Fred Smith, Florida and Puerto Rico regionaldirectorJamie Whittaker, AFA 1st vice [resident Adriane Mock, AFA memberCarol Woodson, membership/regional director Ginny Heptig, Central Forida state coordinator Sharing Our HeartsLory LeagueZuPreemABC PetsBeth GreeenbergTHE SURPRISE GUEST BIRDS Mouse birdFinchesGreat-billed ParrotLineolated ParakeetAfrican Grey babiesEdectus Parrot baby Indian RingnecksBlue Yellow-nape Amazon mutationThe baby Edectus Parrot was a female and the timing was perfect when she came in becausewe had just talked about what is meant by "dimorphic."Look for this program at future conventions.
