	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Question : My Orange-winged Amazon has chronic respiratory problems. He does well, except when he gets upset, I can hear that he is congested. He does not sneeze and feels fine otherwise. My veterinarian has done a lot of tests on him, and she thinks he might have Aspergillosis, but is not sure. He is currently on a medication called Diflucon. What tests need to be done to know for sure that he does or does not have this disease? She has already X-rayed him, done some blood tests, but she can't say for sure that is what he has. I'm confused. Please help....</dc:description>
