	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the fall of 1984 I went to Jakartato try to find pheasant pigeons, ofwhich I found nine, and madearrangements to import them. Aslong as I was going to the trouble ofgetting permits and quarantine space,it seemed wise to bring in other dovesand pigeons with them. There weretwelve or so superbs (Ptilinopussuperbus) and a small number ofblack napes (Ptilinopus melanospila),along with other seed eatingdoves and pigeons. In years past I hada pair of green imperial pigeonswhich were very easy to keep andbreed. The availability of fruit doveswas poor, but with this import I reallygot involved with them.In 1985 I received more superbsand black napes and a small numberof black backs (Ptilinopus cineta)with a promise of more. I foolishly letgo of pairs and was left with fivemales. Of course, I never received anymore black backs. Then, in 1986, Ireceived some pink necked doves(Ptilinopus porphyres) from Singapore.In 1987 I received a few pairs ofpink necked green pigeons (Treronvernens) and thick-billed greenpigeons (Treron curvirostra), alsofrom Singapore. The same year I purchaseda pair of Jambu fruit doves(Ptilinopus jambu) from an importerin southern California. These werenew imports. All birds I have hadwere new, wild-trapped birds which,I feel, are the easiest to work with.</dc:description>
