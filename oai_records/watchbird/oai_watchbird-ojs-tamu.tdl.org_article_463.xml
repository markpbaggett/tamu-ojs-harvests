	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Nestled in the verdant wooded andfern covered foothills of the Cascades,thirty-eight miles southeast ofSeattle, Washington in the village ofKent, are the picturesque aviaries ofJoe and Marge Longo. The beautifulsurroundings provided by their 3 . 5acre farm belie the consistently successfulproduction of a wide range ofspecies from psittacines to softbills inimpressive numbers.While most breeders in colderclimes scurry for cover at the firstsign of icy weather, the Longosmerrily cater to their avian friends inthe great outdoors of the Northwest,tromping along snow covered pathsin the heart of winter as easily asthrough fields of wildflowers thatintermingle with the mosses andferns on a pleasant summer's day.And the birds? Well , they do quitenicely in their outdoor pens, offeringup a cornucopia of youngsters.It all began for joe and Margetwenty-four years ago with a pair ofBarbary doves and golden pheasants.The pheasant collection quickly grewto nineteen species, and along withthe collection arose an interest informal avicultural groups, of whichthere were none in Washington focusingon the Longos ' interests. What todo? Why, form a club - so theybecame some of the founding membersof the Washington OrnamentalGame Bird Breeders in 1965 . Joeserved the club as its president, whileMarge oversaw the duties of the clubbulletin as its editor.</dc:description>
