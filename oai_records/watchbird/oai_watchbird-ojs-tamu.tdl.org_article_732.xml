	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This striking laughing thrush isfound as a common resident in theforest undergrowth areas throughoutsoutheast Asia. Imported on a somewhatfrequent basis, its numbers stillremain relatively low in captivity.There are around 50 individuals currentlyhoused in U.S. zoos (privatesector population unknown).Typical of the larger laughingthrushes, it can have an aggressivenature. Although it is sometimes difficultto house in a mixed species aviary,individuals have had successkeeping them in larger aviaries withother birds such as the Gold-crestedMynah, Crested Wood Partridge,Bleeding Heart Dove and Red-billedLeiothrix. The key factor seems to bein avoiding species which competefor food or nesting niches. On thepositive side, it is an extremely personablespecies with an explosive andvariable call.A few zoos have had success breedingthese birds in captivity. The MinnesotaZoo has produced young withregularity. Bird Curator Jim Pichnerhas noted that their birds breedthroughout the year. Nesting is stimulatedwith the addition of lots of nestÂ ing material to the enclosure. Thebirds prefer long, lancelate materialsuch as bamboo leaves . They veryrarely use nest baskets, but choose tobuild five- to six-inch diameter robintypenests five to six feet from theground. Gene rally, three to five eggsare laid, with two to three c hicksfledging. Although the pare nts' diet isomnivorous, they will feed strictlyinsects to the offspring. There is a tendencyfor the birds to re-cycle on tothe nest quickly, and not to fini sh offthe chicks after fledging. At that time,the chicks are pulled and finished bythe staff.More than o ne adult pair cannot bekept together, but they can be set upin large (15'1 x lO'W x 8'H), wellplanted aviaries within vi sual andvocal contact of each other. Minnesotahas kept a flock of six birds, whichhave been raised together since theywere juveniles, but only one adult pairbreeds.Although replacements have beenreadily available from the wild in thepas t, this may not continue in thefuture . Efforts should be made toimprove captive propagation of thisdelightful bird.</dc:description>
