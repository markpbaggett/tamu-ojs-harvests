	<dc:description xml:lang="en">On July 12 , 1980, we purchased apair of lesser sulphur crested cockatoosfrom a couple who had had themfor several years. The birds ' ages wereunknown, however it appeared theywere mature, but not " old:' They hadbeen housed in a wrought-iron cageapproximately 4' x 4 ' x 5' high. WhenI inqu ired as to their diet , I wasstartled to learn they had been fedsunflower seed solely, as the birdswere in perfect feather. The previousowners had supplied them with a nestbox (exact size unknown) andinformed us the birds had chewedand entered it , but had neverattempted actual nesting. The couplehad frequently check the nest. Thepair were held in a cage 6' long x 4 'wide x 4 ' high. A ten gallon metaltrash can "nest" was installed " just incase ,'' and although the birdsattempted to chew around the nesthole, not surprisingly under these circumstances,again no actual nestingwas attempted . We found this pair,like our other pairs of lessers, to bevery shy and secretive. In late April of1983 , they were transferred fromsouthern California to our breedingfarm in western Oregon. They wereput into a fully enclosed but unheatedaviary 12' long x 5' wide with theheight being 10' on one end and graduatingdown to 8' at the other end.They were given a wooden nest 30"deep x 12 ' ' square. We had by thencompletely abandoned metal nests aswe found them to be veritable" ovens" in the summer and " freezers"in the winter. They also did notprovide the psychological stimulationof allowing the pairs to shape the nestÂ hole, a process which is as individ.ualin each of our cockatoo patrs as ts asignature to a human being.</dc:description>
