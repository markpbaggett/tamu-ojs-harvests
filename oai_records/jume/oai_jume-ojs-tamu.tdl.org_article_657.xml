	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this study, the authors describe the mathematical problem solving ability with ethnomathematics nuances of the marble game based on student learning styles. The authors uses qualitative methodology with research instruments are learning style questionnaire, problem solving ability test, and interviews based on problem solving ability indicators. The subjects of this study were 28 grade 7 students in Surakarta City. Students were given a learning style questionnaire then 9 students were selected through purposive sampling to conduct written tests and interviews. Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the ability to solve mathematical problems with ethnomathematics nuances of the marble game, students with visual learning styles are able to fulfill three problem solving indicators and are less able to fulfill the indicator of re-examining the solution obtained. Students with auditory learning styles are able to fulfill all problem solving indicators well. And students with kinesthetic learning styles are able to fulfill three problem solving indicators and cannot fulfill the indicator of checking back the answer</dc:description>
