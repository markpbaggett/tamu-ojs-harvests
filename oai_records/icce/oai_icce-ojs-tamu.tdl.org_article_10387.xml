	<dc:description xml:lang="en">During the fall and winter of 2015, a beneficial-use of dredged material project taking material from the Galveston Entrance Channel and placing it on a severely eroded beach of Galveston Island was conducted. This material was estimated to have 38percent fines. This operation was conducted again in the fall of 2019 and monitored for estimation of the loss of fines, changes in compaction and color from the dredging source to the beach. The local community and state funded the incremental cost at approximately $8 a cubic yard in 2015, and $10.5 a cubic yard in 2019 to have this material pumped to the beach. The projects were closely monitored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the USACE Galveston District. The data from this placement project was used to calculate and better understand the loss of fines during the dredging and placement process as well as aid in the generation of an empirical formula to estimate the loss of fine sediments during dredging and beach placement. This formula takes into account: losses due to dredging equipment operations, slope of the effluent return channel at the beach, sediment settling velocity, and sorting parameter.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/VQ36upT2iQo</dc:description>
