	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Site specific bedload and suspended sediment transport data collected at two test pit locations over a four-day period during April 2015 were analyzed to calibrate a numerical sediment transport model of Cook Inlet, AK. The field data campaign was designed to collect suspended load and bedload field measurements and was carried out in two phases. During Phase 1, both suspended load and bedload measurements were taken at approximately 55 ft water depth. The suspended sediment concentration was observed to be nearly uniform over the water column. Laboratory analysis showed the suspended sediment had an effective grain size of approximately 0.03 mm with 0.005 mm within a 95percent confidence interval. During Phase 2, hydrodynamic, suspended load and bedload measurements were collected over four tidal cycles in the surfzone. A two-dimensional sediment transport model was developed to simulate sediment transport infill rates at the dredged areas of the Project site. The model was calibrated by comparing measured suspended load measurements made at two offshore locations. Calibration results showed that the suspended load transport rate, which is the dominant sediment transport regime in the area, can be predicted accurately at the project site. Based on the calibrated sediment transport model, preliminary annual sediment infill rates were estimated to lie between 1.1 to 1.6 ft/yr at offshore and nearshore locations, respectively, for the presently observed and measured conditions.</dc:description>
