	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Perforated caisson structure was usually adopted by harbor engineering design to reduce wave height and wave forces on the structure. Through wave physical model test, wave height distribution in front of non-perforated and perforated caisson with different directions was studied respectively with the layout of a project in China. And then dissipation effect of wave height of perforated caisson was obtained from comparison of the two cases. It was indicated from the results that reduction effect of wave height had great relation with the position of perforation on the caisson when dimension of caisson and perforation, perforation rate were fixed. The perforated caisson had a remarkable wave-dissipation effect when the perforation was between once the wave height above or below the still water level, which proved the rationality of the recommendation of Code for Design and Construction of Breakwaters. It was suggested for this project that design of perforation should be consistent with the code as possible and near the design high water level.</dc:description>
