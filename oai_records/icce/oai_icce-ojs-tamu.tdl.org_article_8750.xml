	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Suyeong Bay near Suyeong River, which is a well-known and highly populated area that offers attractions such as Haeundae and Gwangalli beaches, was extensively damaged by Typhoon Maemi in 2003. This region is exposed to the effects of global warming such as super typhoons, sea level rise, and heavy rain. Lowlands near river mouths are particularly vulnerable to the dual effects of flooding from heavy rain and storm surge. Therefore, accurate predictions of the interaction between river discharge and storm surge are crucial for the safety of residents. In this study, numerical simulations of storm surge and flooding were conducted using Advanced Circulation Model for Oceanic, Coastal, and Estuarine Water (ADCIRC) under Typhoon Maemi conditions. The model grid represented the characteristics of the bay and the domain of the Suyeong River basin accurately. In addition, an unstructured grid was used, which was driven by tidal forcing at the open boundary and river discharge at the upriver boundary. The results of this study indicate that the influence of storm surge and river discharge resulted in water levels of more than 0.381 m compared to estimates without river discharge. This study also examined the vulnerability of the river mouth using water elevation data combined with river discharge and storm surge. Interaction of river discharge and storm surge in coastal-inlet areas is essential for assessing water safety and developing a safety index for flood events.</dc:description>
