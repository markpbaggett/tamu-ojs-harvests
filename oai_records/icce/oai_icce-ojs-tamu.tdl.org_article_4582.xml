	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The design, construction and performance of a shoreparallel nearshore breakwater at Ocean City, NJ (USA) are described. The breakwater, which is connected to a long, high, impermeable groin at 9th Street, was constructed from armor stone removed from the groin when the groin cross-section was lowered. Constructed over a two month period in late 1987 and early 1988, the breakwater caused accretion immediately behind it and erosion along downdrift beaches. A beach fill of 40,000 cu yd of sand was recommended as a part of the original project; however, the beachfill was not placed until the spring of 1990, more than two years after the breakwater/spur was constructed. The project, in the absence of the recommended beach fill, is performing as would be expected. The sand within the groin compartment has been redistributed with a net gain behind the breakwater just downdrift of the 9th street groin and a loss updrift of the groin at 11th street.</dc:description>
