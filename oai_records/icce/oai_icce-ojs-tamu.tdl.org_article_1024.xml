	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Changjiang Estuary is characterized by complex branches and outlets (North Branch, North Channel, North Passage and South Passage). The relatively shallow bathymetry around the mouth limits the navigational potentials (Fig.1). The Deep Waterway Project (DWP) was carried out in the North Passage of South Channel for the purpose of deepening the navigational channel from 7.0m in July 1998 to 8.5m in July 2001 (Phase I), 10.0m in May 2005 (Phase II) and 12.5m in May 2010 (Liu et al. 2004). In addition to dredging, two dykes were constructed to reduce the sediment transport from Jiuduansha and Hengsha Shoals into North Passage. A set of groins was built with connection to dykes for the purpose of strengthening the currents in the middle of channel, which helps the maintenance of the navigational capability.
The construction has significantly changed the local bathymetry in the Changjiang Estuary and within the channel. The high-resolution bathymetry measurements were made over seasons. An evolution trend of the morphological change is revealed, which is discussed in this paper.</dc:description>
