	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The energy in waves which impinge on a porous structure, such as a rubble mound breakwater, is divided into reflected energy, transmitted energy, and the energy dissipated by turbulence within the structure. Numerous studies on various aspects of this problem have been made in the past, the most recent of which are those by Kondo (1970) and Sollitt and Cross (1972). The reader is referred to these latter papers for a literature review and the presentation of the theory of wave transmission through a porous media (also see the previous chapters by these same authors). In the studies by Sollitt and Cross (Chap. 103)&gt; the porous media consisted of crushed stone; whereas, in the tests by Kondo (Chap. 104 ) the porous structure consisted of a lattice of circular cylinders. Experimental data which supplement the data obtained in the tests of Kondo, Sollitt and Cross where made at the University of California on a series of three structures constructed of closely packed uniform spheres. Each structure was installed in turn in a wave channel and subjected to wave action with the wave height being measured both seaward and leeward by resistance-type wave gages. The experimental procedure and results are summarized as follows.</dc:description>
