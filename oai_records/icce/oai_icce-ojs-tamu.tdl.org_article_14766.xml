	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The study of wavebreakers is an important field of research in maritime and coastal engineering. These devices are widely in use for a number of applications; among the others, they are used for protection of harbors, marina, offshore petroleum platforms or other kinds of marine infrastructure from the action of waves and storms. The big impact of their use on the economy and industrial progress of a country gives these infrastructures a very important role Sadeghi(2008). They are also employed for reduction of coastal erosion, which in recent years has particularly intensified due to anthropogenic activities Van(2011). Also, they may be used as Wave Energy Conversion (WEC) systems, devices that convert the energy of the waves in zero-emission electric energy. In particular, the integration of different types of clean energy devices (for example the WECs with floating wind turbines, platforms and the wavebreakers) is crucial to reduce the total Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE). The operation principle of a wavebreaker consists in reflection of the incident wave and dissipation of a fraction of the wave energy through the formation of a swirling and dissipative fluid motion. As a result, the wave energy transmitted behind the body, is a small portion of the energy of the incident wave. Here we focus on floating wavebreakers (FB) which represent a subset of the general class of wavebreakers and are used in a number of situations. The key parameter to be quantified in the analysis of wavebreakers is the transmission coefficient, defined as the ration between the height of the wave transmitted behind the obstacle and that of the incident wave.</dc:description>
