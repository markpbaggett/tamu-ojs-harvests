	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Gansbaai fishing and pleasure craft harbour is situated approximately 160km east of Cape Town. Modifications and extensions were required to the existing breakwater as well as construction of an internal access mound. An investigation was commissioned into alternative construction methods and construction sequences for the modifications and extensions. The aim of the study forming the subject of the paper was to establish as accurately as possible the optimum sequence of construction for the various phases of the work and to establish the optimum construction methods to be adopted so that any damage to the work was minimised as construction proceeded. By means of a three dimensional hydraulic model, alternative construction methods and sequences were investigated under varying wave heights and sea conditions. Minimum wave heights and the sea direction causing damage or localised displacement of the elements of construction were studied.</dc:description>
