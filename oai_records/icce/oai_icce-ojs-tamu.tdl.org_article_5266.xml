	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Wave conditions in hurricanes have been difficult to study because of a lack of high-quality wave data and poor descriptions of the wind field. In the 1994 and 1995 hurricane seasons, two Category 1 hurricanes (Gordon and Felix) approached the North Carolina coast and stalled for a period of about 2 days. Although the storms were minimal hurricanes they produced large swell that persisted for several days. A wave gauging network oftwo to five directional instruments in water depths ranging from 8 to 50 m operated throughout the storms. Because of their proximity to land, both storms were extensively observed by radar and aircraft so that the wind fields are well described. The data set offers an opportunity to evaluate two prediction methods to examine the wave field during these most unusual hurricanes.</dc:description>
