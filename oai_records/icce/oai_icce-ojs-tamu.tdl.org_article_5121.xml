	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this study is to improve general understanding of beach profile dynamics as affected by the interaction between the beach profile and the water table level within the beach by presenting the results of laboratory and numerical studies. Two series of laboratory experiments were conducted in "large" and "small" wave tank facilities. Special attention was given to elevated water table levels to investigate whether or not erosion of the beach face is enhanced. The results of the large wave tank experiments demonstrated a surprising influence of beach water table on profile dynamics including changes in the bar region. Although the experiments in the small wave tank used correctly scaled sand, it was found that the effects documented in the large scale tests could not be duplicated. Furthermore those results were supported by numerical simulation of the internal flow inside the beach. One possibility for the difference is that the sand in the large scale tests was more poorly-sorted than that in the small scale experiments.</dc:description>
