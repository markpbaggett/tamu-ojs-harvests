	<dc:description xml:lang="en">An extensive program of stability experiments in a highly detailed three-dimensional model has recently been completed to define a reconstruction technique for a damaged breakwater (Lillevang, Raichlen, Cox, and Behnke, 1984). Tests were conducted with both regular waves and irregular waves from various directions incident upon the breakwater. In comparison of the results of the regular wave tests to those of the irregular wave tests, a relation appeared to exist between breakwater damage and the accumulated energy to which the structure had been exposed. The energy delivered per wave is defined, as an approximation, as relating to the product of H2 and L, where H is the significant height of a train of irregular waves and L is the wave length at a selected depth, calculated according to small amplitude wave theory using a wave period corresponding to the peak energy of the spectrum. As applied in regular wave testing, H is the uniform wave height and L is that associated with the period of the simple wave train. The damage in the model due to regular waves and that caused by irregular waves has been related through the use of the cumulative wave energy contained in those waves which have an energy greater than a threshold value for the breakwater.</dc:description>
