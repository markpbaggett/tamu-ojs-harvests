	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Taiwan is an island located at the edge of the continental shelf of the East China Sea. Her eastern coast fronts precipitously on the Pacific Ocean, whereas the major part of the western coast is formed by very flat sandy beaches. Various engineering works such as the planning of newly building or extension of harbors, tidal land development, cooling water intake of steam power plants as well as shore protection works have been performed on this coast. However, owing to the geomorphological situation of this coast, monsoons of NNE or NE direction originated from high pressure atomosphere overlaying East Asia continent prevail from September to March, and in the summer months, the coast is assailed by typhoons. Waves caused by these meteorological phenomena are mainly being generated in shallow water region, besides, their fetch areas are limitted by the China mainland and Taiwan island. The forecast technics must be reconsidered in stead of utilizing traditional methods. Most coastal engineering structures are subjected to the waves after breaking since the beach slope is exceptionally flat. Many rivers of rapid stream bring tremendous amount of sediment from the high mountains down to the sea. In consequence, sand drift along this coast is so severe that small harbors will be silted up only a few months during monsoon season or after one strong typhoon assailing.</dc:description>
