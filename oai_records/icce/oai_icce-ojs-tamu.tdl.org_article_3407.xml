	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper deals experimentally with combinations of the pneumatic breakwater and other type breakwaters in order to increase the effectiveness of wave damping. Firstly, a submerged breakwater is picked up, and the wave damping effect of this combined type breakwater is examined. Results obtained in this experiment show that some improvements on the wave damping are found for low frequency waves that cannot be damped by the pneumatic breakwater only. The reason of appearence of the combination effect is explained that a part of energy of the transmitted waves over the submerged breakwater transfers to shorter period waves. Secondly, a floating breakwater is combined with the pneumatic breakwater. Experiments show that the transmission factor for high frequency waves becomes smaller than that of the pneumatic breakwater only, while there is not so much wave damping effect for low frequency waves even when the floating breakwater is combined. In addition, a guide plate is set below the bottom of the floating breakwater in order to increase the horizontal flow velocity for a given air discharge. It is found that the velocity of horizontal surface flow by using the guide plate increases as much as about 1.3 times that in the case of the pneumatic breakwater only. As a result, a little improvement on the wave damping due to the guide plate is also found.</dc:description>
