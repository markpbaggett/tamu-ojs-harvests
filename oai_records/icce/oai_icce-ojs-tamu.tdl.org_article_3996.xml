	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A study of surges and waves was initiated because of serious bank erosion along the Sabine-Neches Waterway, located in East Texas. The Waterway provides ship access from the Gulf of Mexico to Port Arthur and Beaumont. The design water depth in the ship channel is 12.12 m (40 ft). The 1978 tonnage of ships using the waterway was 69,740,900 tons (1). The highway on the east bank of the Waterway between Port Arthur and Mesquite Pt. leading to Louisiana had to be relocated several times because of bank erosion. The erosion was thought to be principally caused by ship traffic generating surges and waves. The main purpose of the study was to: 1. evaluate the magnitude of surges and waves generated by ships using the Waterway, 2. evaluate bank erosion potential, and 3. evaluate and recommend the most economical structural measures to prevent further bank erosion. The results of this first part of the study are reported in this paper.</dc:description>
