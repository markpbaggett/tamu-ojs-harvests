	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Simultaneous offshore and onshore wind measurements were made at stations ranging from Somalia, near the equator, to the Gulf of Alaska. Offshore data obtained from standard U.S. NOAA buoys, research platforms, and merchant ships were compared with data from coastal stations. The results indicated that, under the commonly observed speed of 5-6 m/s, land measurements of mean wind speed are only 63% of the offshore mean speed. Furthermore, it was found that only those stations located in the beach area that measure wind speed above both the internal boundary layer and the nocturnal inversion height represent offshore conditions. In order to correct land-measured wind data, a formula is developed and verified by all 2/3 existing data sets. A simplified equation, i.e., U = 3 U1 s is proposed for offshore applications. Criteria for in situ wind measurements near the coast are outlined. Data reduction procedures for inland stations are also provided.</dc:description>
