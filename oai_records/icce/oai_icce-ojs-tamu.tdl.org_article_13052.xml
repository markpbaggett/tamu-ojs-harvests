	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In tropical marine systems, water quality, coral health, fish habitat productivity and various other factors (e.g.: water temperature, salinity, turbidity) are all inter-related. Therefore, shoreline development, and the related design and construction of waterfront projects, may have a significant impact on the marine environment, both positive and negative, depending on the location and quality of science, engineering, and marine ecology undertaken during design, construction, and monitoring. Evaluating the physical, ecological, and social impacts of coastal projects after construction is rarely undertaken in any quantitative manner, if at all. As part of our standard process, we include monitoring for a period of 2- 5 years to quantify shoreline stability, water quality impacts, and increases in biological production as well as biodiversity. To determine when environmental arguments against development are valid and to counter those against research due to time and cost pressures, the goal is to identify what is important for minimizing environmental impacts of development.          </dc:description>
