	<dc:description xml:lang="en">For the design of the storm surge barrier in the Eastern Scheldt, a study has been carried out on wave impacts against coastal and marine structures. First a review was made of relevant literature, including both wave impacts on coastal structures and slamming of sea-going vessels. From this, the so-called Bagnolds piston model emerged as most appropriate to describe the wave impacts caused by standing waves against protruding elements. This model was then further elaborated to include both adiabatic and isothermal compression of the air cushion and to allow for the compression of the water. Moreover, a model was developed to determine the spatial pressure distribution. Finally, experiments were performed, the results of which were in satisfactory agreement with the mathematical models. Based upon the results of these studies, a scaling law is presented here, from which the pressure magnitude and the time history of the impact in nature may be determined.</dc:description>
