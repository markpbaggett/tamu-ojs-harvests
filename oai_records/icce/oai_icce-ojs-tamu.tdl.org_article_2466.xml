	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The authorfe conception on the mechanism of continuous slope protection under wave action (elements of flexible screen theory) are given in the paper in brief. Slope structures with continuous revetments are widely used in the Soviet Union, not only in canals but even in large reservoirs where waves reach nearly sea wave height. When ordinary design methods are used, strength and stability of the revetment is provided by its thickness increase, and an expensive filter layer is placed under the revetment, Though continuous revetments were expensive, slope structures proved to be cheaper and more reliable than other measures of protection against wave action. Now it appears that the revetment's stress conditions may be improved by reducing its thickness and eliarijaatiyjtfee filter layer. There are types of coverings, the flexibility of which contributes to the self-consolidation of sand soil, filling the voids, and reducing the effective wave pressure. There exists however a definite thickness minimum (critical rigidity) below which dangerous slope deformations occur. The various attempts to determine this critical rigidity are shortly reported below. Results of laboratory and field tests are given, permitting to get knowledge of physical processes occurring under the revetment and of structural features improving their reliability,</dc:description>
