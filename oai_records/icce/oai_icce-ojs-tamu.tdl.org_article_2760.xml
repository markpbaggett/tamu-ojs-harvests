	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A solution of finite amplitude long waves on constant sloping beaches is obtained by solving the equations of the shallow water theory of the lowest order. Non-linearity of this theory is taken into account, using the perturbation method. Bessel functions involved in the solution are approximated with trigonometric functions. The applicable range of this theory is determined from the two limit conditions caused by the hydrostatic pressure assumption and the trigonometric function approximation of Bessel functions. The shoaling of this finite amplitude long waves on constant sloping beaches is discussed. Especially, the effects of the beach slope on the wave height change and the asymmetric wave profile near the breaking point are examined, which can not be explained by the concept of constancy of wave energy flux based on the theory of progressive waves in uniform depth. These theoretical results are presented graphically, and compared with curves of wave shoaling based on finite amplitude wave theories. On the other hand, the experiments are conducted with respect to the transformation of waves progressing on beaches of three kinds of slopes ( 1/30, 1/2.0 and 1/10 ) . The experimental results are compared with the theoretical curves to confirm the validity of the theory.</dc:description>
