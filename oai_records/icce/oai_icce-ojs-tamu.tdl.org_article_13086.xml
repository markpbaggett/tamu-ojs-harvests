	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Port Beach, a popular beach in the metro area of Perth, Western Australia, is the result of 130 years of development of Fremantle Port. During many stages of development, dredged material has been disposed of at Port Beach which has resulted in a source of sand as well as undesirable material on the beach as well and in the nearshore environment. Erosion of this beach became noticeable in the 1990s and a major storm in 2003 resulted in damage to infrastructure. In 2018 Port Beach was designated the highest erosion risk beach in the Assessment of Coastal Erosion Hotspots in Western Australia by DoT and the Department of Planning, Lands, and Heritage (DPLH). In 2017, the City of Fremantle completed a Coastal Hazard Risk Management and Adaptation Plan (CHRMAP) for the Port, Leighton and Mosman Beaches in partnership with the Town of Mosman Park. Through this process, Port Beach was identified as being at extreme risk from erosion in the short term to 2030, and it was recommended that the City implement either (i) a seawall and nourishment or (ii) dune stabilisation, revegetation, and nourishment. In the longer term to 2050 onward, protection or retreat was recommended.          </dc:description>
