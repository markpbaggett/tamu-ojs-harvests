	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Flooding in many coastal regions is exacerbated due to complex interactions of multiple flood drivers such as rainfall-runoff and coastal surge which can occur simultaneously or sequentially during storm events, leading to compound flooding hazards. The Texas Gulf Coasts (USA) are especially vulnerable from compound flooding due to frequent occurrence of tropical storms which bring strong winds to drive storm surge and heavy rainfall to generate inland flooding. Large scale studies {Coastal Texas Restoration and Protection Study (CTX, 2021), Texas General Land Officeâ€™s Texas River Basin Study, Base Level Engineering Study} are being conducted by state and federal agencies for flood hazard assessment and for development of mitigation and abatement strategies for reducing this risk and increasing community resilience. Traditionally, large scale storm surge models do not account for runoff contributions to water levels in the interior of their domain. Riverine models for their part use either normal depth or mean high water levels to assign downstream boundary conditions within tidally influenced area, thus ignoring effects of storm surge. In this Planning Assistance to States (PAS) study, located in the Lower Clear Creek and Dickinson Bayou watersheds (Texas, USA), we have evaluated rainfall-runoff and storm surge interactions to determine suitable locations to use as model boundary conditions for exchanging data between rainfall-runoff and surge models under compound flooding conditions.</dc:description>
