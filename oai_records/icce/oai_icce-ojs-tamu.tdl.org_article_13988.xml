	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In late July of 2023, Super Typhoon Doksuri (local name: Egay) hit the northern part of the Philippines with a peak intensity of 185 km/h and 925 hPa. Storm surges were expected to occur in the area with Doksuri making a direct hit and staying over the Babuyan group of islands. However, no official measurements of surge levels were known to be reported. Thus, there is a need to investigate how high the storm surges could have been on these islands using numerical models. The WRF-FVCOM weather-surge models were used to simulate Doksuri and its potential storm surge at the islands. Although the simulated peak intensities are within good agreement with the observed data, the track deviated northward as it entered the smallest domain where the islands are located. This resulted in simulated storm surge heights of around 0.21-0.48 meters, which were smaller than expected. Improvements in the simulations, particularly on the downscaling of the typhoon over the small islands, are recommended to further understand the potential storm surges in these islands.</dc:description>
