	<dc:description xml:lang="en">An operational wave forecast of the area near the mouth of the Columbia River is presented. This region is known for its large waves and strong tidal currents. The forecast is forced with full directional spectra obtained from a refined WaveWatchIII forecast of the Pacific Northwest, and tidal current inputs are obtained from an estuarine circulation forecast of the Columbia River. The forecast has been operational since August 2011 providing short-term predictive wave information at the mouth of the Columbia River. Results from a 6-month period are promising, with a normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) of 16% at the location of an inshore buoy, which is located outside the zone of tidal influence in 25 m water depth. Near the river mouth and in the channel, wave heights are heavily dominated by the tidal currents which significantly increase wave heights on ebb tides. Hindcast results shows that the model is able to predict the general effect of the tidal currents with a NRMSE of 30% in wave heights at the river mouth. Despite some of the model limitations, it still provides valuable information to navigators and bar pilots since it includes the effects of the tidal currents.</dc:description>
