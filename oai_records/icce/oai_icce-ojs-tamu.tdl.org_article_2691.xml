	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Grain size and heavy mineral analyses of 6 cliff, 12 beach, and 44 marine sediment and rock samples from Bolmas Bay and its surrounding drainage area were done as part of a long term study of sediment transport on the continental shelf off Central California Sediments in the bay are predominately very fine sands Some samples, particularly adjacent to Duxbury Reef on the west, have a coarse sand to pebble component The primary mode of the marine samples is in the range 088 to 125 mm, whereas, the primary mode for beach material is from 175 to 25 mm The range of median diameters of the marine samples is from 07 to 14 mm The median diameters show a trend of decreasing grain size seaward parallel to the depth contours except opposite the entrance to Bolmas Lagoon where a tongue of relatively coarser material cuts across the depth contours The range of other statistical parameters are (1) sorting coefficient 1 10 to 1 41, (2) skewness 0 83 to 1 18, and (3) kurtosis 0 15 to 0 32 Our sediment studies indicate (1) The heavy mineral assemblage is predominantly green hornblende with secondary amounts of hypersthene and augite Glaucophane and jadeite occur in locally high concentrations near shore (2) The pattern of distribution of the heavy minerals shows (a) a tongue of high concentrations of minerals with a granitic source extending northwest from the San Francisco Bar, (b) flanked on the north and northeast by increasing landward concentrations of Franciscan metamorphic minerals (3) The major source of heavy minerals is the San Francisco Bar Secondary contributions come from Bolmas Lagoon and the adjacent cliffs (4) The circulation in the Bay is primarily counterclockwise, produced by a combination of wave refraction around Duxbury Reef and the tidal Coast Eddy Current The tidal influence, however, of Bolmas Lagoon is restricted to about one mile from the lagoon mouth.</dc:description>
