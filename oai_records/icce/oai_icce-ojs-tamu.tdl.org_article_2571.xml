	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The general objective of this investigation is to determine the wave damping characteristics of model floating breakwaters designed to reduce incident wave heights by processes of wave reflection, wave interference, forced instability of incident waves and turbulence action. Of most interest is the attempt to determine the method and the extent to which the requirement of large mass may be usefully replaced by large moment of inertia of mass in the development of floating breakwaters. Experiments are conducted in a two-dimensional wave channel. Reflection coefficients, transmission coefficients, breakwater motions and mooring forces are determined by experiments. It is found that the range of effectiveness in wave attenuation of floating breakwaters depends on several factors including breakwater design, incident wave properties, depth of water and the motion characteristics of the structures, it is remarkable that the 'A' Frame Breakwater exemplifies that the range of effectiveness of a floating breakwater can be increased by a large increase of its radius of gyration involving only a slight increase of its mass. The mooring forces are of reasonable magnitude. Experimental measurements and observations indicate that the 'A' Frame Breakwater is stable throughout the range of model tests.</dc:description>
