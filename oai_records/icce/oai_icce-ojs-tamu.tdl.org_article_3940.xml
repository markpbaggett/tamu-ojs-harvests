	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In order to cope with such environmental problems as shoreline change and diffusion of discharged warm water and contaminations in the surf zone, it is necessary to predict velocity vector field due to nearshore currents accurately. The present study is aimed at establishing a mathematical model applicable to the prediction of nearshore currents on actual coasts which have complicated bottom configurations. First, to investigate the mechanism of nearshore current generation hydraulic experiments were carried out. By the experiment it was made clear that the generation of a longshore current depends mainly upon a difference in mean water level in the longshore direction. After investigating estimation of radiation stress terms on the basis of the information obtained from the basic experiments a mathematical model of nearshore currents was developed and validity of the model was verified by both hydraulic model tests and field survey.</dc:description>
