	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Details of a velocity field around a prolate spheroid in a steady flow with different angles of attack were investigated by carrying out a hydraulic experiment using the PTV technique. It was found that characteristics of the vortex in the wake of the prolate spheroid were different depending on the angle of attack. It was clearly found that the velocity field changes significantly in the wake. That is to say that there were some areas with strong and weak turbulence and that also some areas with a certain periodic and unclear periodic velocity change with significant change. It was clear that these characteristics depend on the angle of attack of the spheroid. Further, it was confirmed that the distribution of the turbulence intensity was different between the horizontal and vertical components.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/34Dw1CSLEz4</dc:description>
