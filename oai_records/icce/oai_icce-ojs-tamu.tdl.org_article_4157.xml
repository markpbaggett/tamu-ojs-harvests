	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Recently, as well as hydraulic stability, structural strength of armor blocks has emerged as a major problem in breakwaters. This problem is studied by research organizations in many countries. In Nippon Tetrapod Co., Ltd., a series of hydraulic model tests was conducted to measure the surface strain on Tetrapods under wave action. In this paper, the results of the hydraulic model test are described. Prior to the hydraulic test, a similitude relation on impact stress and strain between the prototype and model was derived and a drop test was performed to investigate the scale effect on impact strain on Tetrapods. The hydraulic test was conducted to measure the surface strain on 50kg model Tetrapods using strain gages. In addition, impact strain on 50t Tetrapods under wave action was estimated applying the similitude relation. The strain on Tetrapods under wave action was clarified through this study.</dc:description>
