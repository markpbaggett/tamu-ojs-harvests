	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Using the coastal evolution of the Netherlands in the Holocene up to the present as an example and a test case, a coastal evolution concept is proposed and materialized with which shoreline position changes for different sea level rise scenarios are predicted. The (more generally applicable) model applies to quasi-uniform coastal stretches. It accounts for morphodynamic processes from the shelf to the first dune-row, and integrates over coastal units of approximately 10 km alongshore length. The added value, compared to earlier published concepts or models, lies in the full inclusion of crossshore and alongshore processes, and in the distinction between a - with respect to sea level rise - instantaneously responding active zone and a noninstantaneously responding central shoreface zone. Relevant differences have been found to exist between coastal cells on the closed and the interrupted coast. An important conclusion is that the cross-shore effective Bruun-effect is only of limited importance. This is especially true in the case of the interrupted coast. Longshore sand transport gradients are very large there. This is mainly related to the sand demand which is placed on coastal stretches adjacent to estuary mouths of those estuaries which tend to follow the sea level rise.</dc:description>
