	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The seiche activity in several West Coast harbors has been investigated during the past two years. This investigation has been oriented mainly as an experimental problem in which a new oceanographic instrument, the solion infrasonic hydrophone, is used to detect bottom pressure fluctuations over a range of 5 sec to 1800 sec periods.
A limited theoretical consideration of this problem is presented in an attempt to correlate the seiche phenomenon to the harbor geometry. The data presented in this paper are for San Diego Bay and Long Beach Harbor. These data were recorded on magnetic tape and returned to the laboratory for analysis. This analysis consists of prewhitening the data with bandpass filters and then computing the power spectra by the method of Blackman and Tukey. A short discussion is presented to relate the use of this type of data to the study of two harbor engineering problems, ship mooring and close quarter navigation.</dc:description>
