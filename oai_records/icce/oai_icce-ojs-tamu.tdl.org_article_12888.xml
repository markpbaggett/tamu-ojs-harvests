	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Breakwaters for outer harbor facilities are considerably affected by wave conditions, rendering the control of caisson motion difficult. Its motion during breakwater installation is important to improve its operational efficiency and safety. In recent years, caisson motion has been studied using 3D solid-gas-liquid three-phase simulations. Nakamura et al. (2021) investigated the dynamic characteristics of floating caissons under regular and irregular waves. Takagi et al. (2021) studied its sway and contact with mounds when the bottom clearance was changed and demonstrated the validity of their numerical method. However, due to inevitable scale effects of the small-scale experiments and simulations, these studies require examination at a large scale. In this study, the numerical simulation developed by Arikawa et al. (2009) was used to investigate the motion characteristics of life-sized floating caissons under regular and irregular waves for case studies conducted at the Port of Kochi (Ishimi et al. 1996).</dc:description>
