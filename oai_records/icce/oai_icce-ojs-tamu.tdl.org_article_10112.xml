	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Concerns about the impacts of more severe and frequent storms as a result of climate change is giving rise around the world to a variety of responses from governments, communities and property owners. In some countries there have been legislative responses. In other countries there has been an increase in litigation about coastal management issues and rights. Some of our cases were featured in the UN paper entitled "The Status of Climate Change Litigation". We will also what lessons can be learned from these cases for coastal engineers currently analysing coastal processes and dynamics as part of an active coastal management process. Court cases bring the professional assessments of coastal engineers under close scrutiny. Evidence may be required according to court rules and procedures with which most engineers are not familiar. In our presentation we will review the latest in developments around the globe.</dc:description>
