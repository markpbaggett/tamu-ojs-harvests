	<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the development of large scale wharf construction and more application in the deep water areas, A new type of wharf named sheet-pile wharf with separated relieving platform was developed in China, which has been applied more and more in new large wharf construction and reforming construction of existing small wharf in the deep water. Compared to the traditional sheet-pile wharf, the separated relieving platform structure, which is made of relieving platform and piles, is the special part for the new kind of wharf. Due to the existence of platform structure, the upper vertical loads can be partly carried by platform and transferred to the deeper foundation soil directly, and the horizontal soil pressure from landside can also be born by piles. Therefore, the loads carried by the front wall have been reduced markedly. In order to clarify the load transfer mechanism of the new structure, the field test has been conducted. The measuring instruments have been installed during wharf construction, and the main measurements were displacements and stresses of structures and pulling force of tie bar. With the instruments referred above, the behavior of the whole wharf has been in completion.</dc:description>
