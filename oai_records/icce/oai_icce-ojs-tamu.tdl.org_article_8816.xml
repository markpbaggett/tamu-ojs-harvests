	<dc:description xml:lang="en">During coastal construction works, damages often occur to temporary constructions consisting of fine and often wide graded rock material due to exposure to waves. Examples of vulnerable structures are the bunds that are constructed to serve as the core for a breakwater before placement of the filter and armour layers, or as temporary defense during reclamation works. Such structures - mostly built in bulk - are temporarily exposed to wave conditions, and will reshape depending on the duration of exposure and the prevailing hydraulic conditions. For the exposed breakwater core, it is important to have an idea on how much of the placed material will be moved outside the perimeter, and thus how much material needs to be rehandled before the cover layers can be constructed. For temporary defense works, it is important to know how much material needs to be placed initially in order to offer sufficient protection for a certain period. For both cases, an accurate prediction of the reshaping of such structures is necessary.</dc:description>
