	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper presents an analysis of physical model tests of the swash zone. A mild, impermeable slope was used to create a wide swash zone. Bichromatic and irregular waves with varying wave heights, wave periods and wave grouping were tested. The experiments showed the swash zone to be dominated by low frequency motions, which were closely related to the incident wave groups. The incident waves were still grouped in the surf and swash zones. An empirical relationship was determined, relating the long wave height at the shoreline to the deep water wave parameters. The long waves were found to be partially reflected from the swash zone and this partial reflection was successfully simulated by the superposition of an absorbed and a reflected long wave. The generation of spurious long waves and the seiche at the natural frequency of the equipment were also investigated.</dc:description>
