	<dc:description xml:lang="en">aerial remote sensing techniques and provides a current state of the art summary of the utilization of aerial remote sensors in coastal engineering studies. The sensors' discussed include conventional black and white aerial photographs, black and white infrared aerial photographs, color and color infrared aerial photographs, multispectral aerial photographs, satellite photographs, infrared imagery, multispectral imagery, and radar imagery. The field of coastal engineering is considered in a broad context to include all important applications of aerial remote sensing that relate to coastal engineering problems. The use of remote sensors to monitor coastal changes, study coastal landforms, examine storm effects, map coastal areas, determine nearshore hydrography, and monitor the environmental effects of coastal engineering projects, a topic of considerable current concern, is described. The important characteristics of the various aerial remote sensors are described briefly. The advantages and limitations of the aerial remote sensing techniques for different coastal engineering studies are noted. The review and state of the art summary of the applications of the aerial remote sensors can be used by coastal engineers as guidelines in employing the sensors in future coastal engineering investigations.</dc:description>
