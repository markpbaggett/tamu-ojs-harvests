	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In recent years, tropical cyclones in the northwestern Pacific have been predicted to intensify due to the warming ocean caused by global warming [1]. Especially in Japan, typhoons have caused severe wind and flood damage. Highly accurate typhoon modeling is required to evaluate future coastal hazards such as storm surges and waves. However, typhoon modeling is often based on only meteorological models and does not consider typhoon-induced ocean response and wave effects that control the boundary conditions between a typhoon and an ocean. Furthermore, the ocean characteristics are closely linked to typhoon ones. However, its representation has been incomplete. These factors lead to uncertainties in typhoon modeling, which also affects the assessment of coastal disasters such as storm surges. In this study, we simulated Jebi in 2018 using the coupled atmosphere-ocean-wave transport (COAWST) modeling System [2] to investigate the impact of ocean response and wave effects on a typhoon.</dc:description>
