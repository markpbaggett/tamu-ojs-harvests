	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study is to validate the tsunami model with extensive field observation data gathered from the 2006 Java tsunami. In the relevant study area, where highly-resolved geometric data were recently made available and other related post-tsunami field data have been collected, the tsunami maximum run-up onto land and its marigram have been simulated and evaluated. Several plausible tsunami sources are proposed to adequately mimic the 2006 Java tsunami by including the influence of low rigidity material in the accretionary prism as well as its single-multi fault source type's effect. Since it has a significant role on tsunami excitation, this parameter and other assumptions are then employed to study an estimated set of reasonable maximum magnitude earthquake-tsunami scenario and projected inundation areas for probable future tsunami on the South Java coastline. In a final step tentative technical mitigation measures are proposed and assessed to deal with adequate coastal protection issues by means of soft (greenbelt, etc.) and hard engineering (sand dunes, etc.) approaches. Their effectiveness in terms of reducing inundation area is assessed and general recommendations for coastal planning authorities are dealt with.</dc:description>
