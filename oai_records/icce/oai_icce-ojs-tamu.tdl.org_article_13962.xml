	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Worldwide beaches and dunes are under coastal erosion due to sediments deficit and climate change effects, leading to the shoreline retreat and loss of territory. The reports about events of coastal overtopping and flooding are being more frequent in last few years. In fact, overtopping can occur during extreme events, such as storms, or more recurrently, due to sea level rise or coastal erosion. When the wave runup exceeds the maximum height of a coastal structure, whether natural (dune) or a coastal defence work, overtopping will flood the adjacent areas. This work aimed to evaluate the behaviour of the beach profile and its effects on overtopping of dunes and coastal structures. In front of longitudinal rocky revetments, due to the waves reflective effect, a deepening trend of the cross-shore bottom profiles is observed, requiring structures reinforced foundations and/or increased crest levels. These cross-shore sediments dynamic associated with the scarcity of sediments (areas protected by coastal works usually present a sediment deficit and erosion problems), will increase the depth, which will consequently allow higher waves breaking nearshore, also increasing overtopping. This behaviour was tested in a flume, for two different beach profiles, with a coastal structure. Then, discussing eventual mitigation measures, different scenarios of artificial nourishments were tested in a numerical model, CS-Model, for a cross-shore profile with a dune being overtopped. Options included reinforcing the dune in different locations and with different deposited volumes. The objective was to evaluate the impact of different scenarios of artificial sand nourishments, in order to mitigate coastal overtopping, in generic wave climate and geometric profile conditions, representative of the northwest Portuguese coast. The obtained results show that there is a deepening trend of the bottom in front of coastal structures and the best way of artificially nourish beach profiles can be discussed using numerical models, helping in future maintenance of coastal structures and design of nourishment projects.</dc:description>
