	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The high-energy swells in the Northern Pacific are generally due to extratropical cyclones during the winter season. Conserving most of their energy while traveling long distances, strong swells increase the susceptibility of coastal zones of remote islands by increasing their vulnerability. Understanding the vulnerability caused by distant source generated swells allows adaptive attempts to be taken to protect natural, social, cultural and economic assets. The extratropical cyclone trends and its relation to swells requires a need to quantify its effect on island coastlines. The vulnerability is a complex phenomenon that demands multidisciplinary approaches, methods, and data sources to estimates of the impacts objectively. The main problem when it comes to defining vulnerability of small island communities is that even the unforeseen elements affect their susceptibility because they are more prone to the impacts of climatic forcing. Therefore, in this study, we extend an existing approach to quantify how extratropical storm generated swells affect the vulnerability of remotely located tropical islands.</dc:description>
