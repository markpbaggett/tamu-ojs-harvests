	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Model tests have been carried out to obtain an insight into the magnitude of the wave-pressures in various situations. These tests showed, that sharp high pressure peaks occur in addition to the pressures caused by the reflecting of the waves, which pressures are quasi-static. As the structure can be compared with a multiple mass-spring system these pressure-peaks may cause the whole construction to vibrate. Wave-attack therefore can be expressed in terms of impact. Moreover, calculations revealed that the impact pressures were critical factors in determining the strength of the structure.
So many model tests were carried out to determine the design and location of the sluices. These tests involved numerous water-levels discharges and waves. Regarding the pressure-peaks a comparative study was made in the model, which led to the structure being designed in such a way that the occurrence of critical impacts was reduced to an acceptable minimum. As it was impossible to avoid the occurrence of impact pressures entirely it remained necessary to determine a basic load for the structure that takes care of the impact pressures. As it has not yet appeared possible physically to determine a theoretical maximum for the impact pressures, it has to be borne in mind that there is a probability that each pressure measured will be exceeded. So this paper describes, how the cumulative frequency curve of the impacts for the case mentioned in 1.1 sub a, which served as a basis for determining the basic load was arrived at by a certain combination of laboratory and field observations. The data used for this purpose were a. Results of wave-impact measurements on a model of the sluices. This model, built in accordance with the results of the comparative study, was situated in the wind-flume of the "de Voorst" hydraulic laboratory. b. Wave height measurements in the Haringvliet during 1957 and 1958. c. Wind-speed measurements on board the lightship Qoeree, likewise during 1957 and 1958. d. Tidal registrations at Hellevoetsluis from 1920 to 1960. e. Wind-force data from the Hook of Holland, likewise from 1920 to 1960.</dc:description>
