	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The increasing frequency of storm surges driven by erratic climatic patterns linked to climate change has intensified overtopping events at coastal structures. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a valuable tool in predicting overtopping, complementing traditional empirical, physical, and numerical methods. The study investigates the application of two DT-based algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and three kernel-based algorithms, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machines Regression (SVR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting overtopping at sloping breakwaters. Required pre- and post-processing steps, such as feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, were integrated using a methodological framework and the prediction results were evaluated in terms of statistical metrics. The GPR algorithm was found to be the most accurate of the five algorithms tested, with r2, R, RMSE and MAE values of 0.87, 0.94, 0.00031 and 0.23, respectively. Computational efficiency of the GBDT model was the highest among all the models. The physical consistency of the models was reported by applying feature importance analysis and the results were in agreement with the physical process of overtopping. The findings of this study can be beneficial for coastal engineers for fast and informed prediction tasks of wave overtopping at sloping structures.</dc:description>
