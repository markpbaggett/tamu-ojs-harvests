	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tsunamis have distinctly different scour mechanisms compared with wind-generated waves or steady currents. Tonkin et al. (2003) showed that the shear stress measured on the sandy bed during the tsunami draw- down cannot qualitatively explain the rapid erosion around an monopile. They attributed this rapid erosion to the seepage response in the underlying soil induced by the rapidly decreasing water level. When the tsunami- induced upward pore-pressure gradient exceeds the buoyant weight of the sediment, the effective stress between sediment grains could vanish to form momentary liquefaction. Yeh and Mason (2014) reported the momentary liquefaction induced by the 1960 Chilean tsunami under no ground shaking and low flow velocity. These studies have identified that the seepage response can affect sediment transport and tsunami-induced scour, while the classic sediment transport model (e.g. used in Larsen et al. 2017) without considering seepage cannot well simulate the tsunami scour processes. It is technically not possible to directly observe the seepage effects on tsunami scour in a laboratory experiment in a wave flume, as the wave-induced seepage within the surficial seabed is commonly very low compared with the buoyant weight of the sediment. This study aims to numerically quantify the contributions from the dynamic seepage response to tsunami-induced scour by a fully coupled hydrodynamic and morphological model. The role of seepage response in tsunami-induced sandy seabed scour beneath a submarine pipeline and around a monopile is discussed. This study will pave the way for better predictions of the tsunami scour.</dc:description>
