	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Cost-benefit analysis emerges as an indispensable component for coastal management by governing state agencies, for defining intervention priorities along the coastline, enabling greater technical and economic sustainability in decision-making. The paradigm shift towards proactive coastal zone planning is imperative and leads to increasingly effective management of worldwide coastlines. The COAST4US project was founded on this purpose, presenting a management strategy for the Portuguese west coast based on the results of applying the COAST (Coastal Optimization ASsessment Tool). The COAST4US project was initiated with the objective of defining coastal erosion mitigation scenarios and assess their cost-benefit, applying COAST across three severely eroded coastal stretches along the Portuguese coast: Aveiro, Figueira da Foz, and Costa de Caparica. Therefore, the primary aim of this work is to present the principal findings, conclusions, and insights for the future, not only regarding the northwest Portuguese coast, but also its potential of applicability to other sandy beaches worldwide. The application of the COAST tool to the Portuguese coastline supports the adoption of preventive management policies and sustainable long-term planning towards more effective management. A crucial insight derived from this work is that almost all the proposed scenarios were considered valid and feasible solutions from a physical point of view. However, the COAST tool revealed that more than half of these scenarios would not be economically viable in the analyzed time-horizon (20 years). Thus, these findings underscore the importance of cost-benefit analysis and the COAST4US project as valuable assets in supporting coastal management.</dc:description>
