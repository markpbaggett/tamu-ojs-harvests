	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this paper, the authors describe the salinity problems and their solutions which were encountered in the Obitsui River Water Scheme. The salinity problems in this water scheme are caused by differnt origins; The one is seepage of the sea water through the earth embankment, and the other is the diffusion of the saline water from the reservoir bed. Laboratory experiments and field observations were performed to confirm the detailed design of the reservoir. It was found that the salinity concentration of the reservoir water could be controlled less than 500ppm m weight, when the earth embankment of 1,000m width was released. The another way of salinity control studied by the authors was the recharging channel. At the present stage of studies, the recharging channel is considered to be favourable. Finally, the wind effect on the mterfacial mixing of the salt and fresh water in a reservoir was studied. An approximate theory to calculate the mixing rate of the salt water was derived from the field observations.</dc:description>
