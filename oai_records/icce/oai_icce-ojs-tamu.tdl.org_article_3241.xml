	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Analytical results are presented which describe the mechanisms of longitudinal dispersive mass transport in rectangular channels of finite and infinite widths for both unidirectional (river) and oscillatory (tidal) flow regimes. Emphasis is placed upon the discussion of results and the characteristics of longitudinal dispersive mass transport revealed by the analytical treatment. Expressions presented for the dispersion coefficient were obtained from solutions to four sets of boundary value problems for the velocity and concentration variation components u" and c". Examination of these expressions reveals that in oscillatory flow the dispersive mass transport is described by a type of resonant interaction between the period of oscillation and the time scales of vertical and lateral mixing. The analysis also shows that for oscillatory flow regimes the effect of lateral shear becomes negligible for very wide channels and the three dimensional solution collapses to the two dimensional case in which vertical shear and mixing effects dominate. It is shown analytically that this is not the case in unidirectional flows. For this case the lateral shear and mixing effects dominate the corresponding vertical effects and dispersive mass transport increases without bound with increasing channel widths.</dc:description>
