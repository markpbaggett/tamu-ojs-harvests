	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study deals with the motions of a neutrally buoyant rectangular parallelpiped moored by a linear spring system m standing waves. The results show that a linear theory which considers the response of the body as a smgle-degree-of-freedom oscillator adequately describes the surge motion for standing waves ranging from shallow-water waves to deep-water waves and for ratios of body length to wave length of from 0.1 to 1 5. It was found that the response curves for surge motion become more selective with respect to frequency in the vicinity of resonance as the distance of the body from a reflecting surface increases. Therefore, coupling this with viscous effects, which are more important near resonance, it is possible to reduce the effect of resonance considerably for a moored body with a particular natural frequency by choosing the proper mooring location in its standing wave environment. This has possible application in the planning of berthing facilities in marinas.</dc:description>
