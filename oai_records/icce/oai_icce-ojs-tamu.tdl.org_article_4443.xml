	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two main items are treated in this paper. The first item is measurement of wave induced velocities in a large scale model and the second one is a verification of the 1-D numerical model, developed by Kobayashi and Wurjanto (1989). Wave induced velocities on a smooth slope were measured in Delft Hydraulics large Delta flume. The run-up and run-down velocities were compared with theoretically derived upper bounds and formulas for these velocities were derived on the basis of these upper bounds. Computations were performed with the numerical model of Kobayashi and the results (velocities, pressures and run-up and run-down levels) were compared with measurements, partly from the investigation mentioned above. The results for run-down velocities and run-up levels were acceptable, the results for run-up velocities were a little worse and the results for pressures and run-down levels were bad.</dc:description>
