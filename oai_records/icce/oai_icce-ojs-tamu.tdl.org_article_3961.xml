	<dc:description xml:lang="en">During the spring of 1982 a new container terminal was under construction at the Port of Haina, Dominican Republic. Changes in design conditions due to damages to the protective breakwaters at the port entrance required modifications to the design of slope protection under the pier. The stabilization of the rubble slope was, in fact, a stop gap measure in that repairs would be instituted on the breakwaters in the near future. Due to a lack of suitable stone, the location of structural elements already in place and severe time constraints, an asphalt coating over relatively light weight rubble was selected to armor the slopes under the pier. The asphalt coating was prepared in a locally available batching plant and placed on-site using a crane equipped with a 4 cubic yard bucket. As a result of the use of the asphalt coating, construction delays were minimized and adequate slope protection was provided for the container pier without extensive design modifications. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the use of asphalt in the construction of shore protection facilities in the context of the site specific application at the Port of Haina.</dc:description>
