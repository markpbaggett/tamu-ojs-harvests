	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The paper deals with the results of a few experiments on the travel of shingle carried out at Rottingdean, near Brighton, by the Author, whilst he was in charge of the sea defence works, which were being erected for the East Sussex County Council. The defence works consist of a number of concrete groynes connected together at the cliff ends by reinforced concrete sea walls. The groynes are 500 feet apart, and it was between two of these that the experiments were carried out. The foreshore is of chalk, and the amount of shingle between the groynes was very small. Often this shingle was heaped up in one of the corners made by the sea wall and the groyne; the remainder of the shore was absolutely bare. This was an advantage, as the specimens could be placed on the clear portion of the shore, and their movements observed, with a minimum danger of their being lost and unrecognised by being in a large mass of shingle. In order to recognise the test pieces, specimens of brick, concrete and granite were used to distinguish them from the shingle flints. But in spite of this and a long clear run of shore, there was sufficient shingle between the groynes to hide the test specimens once,they had got into the main heap after a rough sea.</dc:description>
