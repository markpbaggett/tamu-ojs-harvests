	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Between the breakwaters of the harbour entrance of Rostock-Warnemunde, located at the Baltic Coast of Germany, a small marina is situated. In 1999 these breakwaters were modified in order to meet the nautical requirements of larger ships.
From this time on, serious problems for the pleasure boats were observed due to wave disturbance. New structural measures like floating breakwaters and vertical walls
(small length) showed only poor improvements.
The objective of the investigations was the functional design of wave protection structures and a layout able to meet the user requirements on a modern marina with
focus on competitive sailing sports. The investigations were assigned by the Sport Confederation of the Federal State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.
To accomplish this objective, numerical simulations as well as small scale hydraulic tests were performed at the University of Rostock.</dc:description>
