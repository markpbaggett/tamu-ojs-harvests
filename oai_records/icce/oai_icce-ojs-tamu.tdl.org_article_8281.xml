	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami was one of the strongest earthquakes which generated a major tsunami in
modern history. The tsunami disaster had an estimated cost of 16.9 trillion yen (US$ 217.3 billion) and affected the Coastal
buildings, services, infrastructure and industrial sectors. Approximately 61% of damaged cost was from the building sector. A
practical predictive scour depth model at seaward face was developed to highlight the scour failure of Coastal buildings in Miyagi,
Fukushima and Iwate prefectures affected by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. The predictive model for
representative scour depth was developed in terms of various hydraulic, geometrical and soil properties affecting Coastal buildings.
An analysis was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of the authors' predictive scour model against the existing models. The
results of the authors' proposed model suggested that the tsunami velocity played a significant role on tsunami-induced scour, other
scour models such as Tonkin et al.'s model (2003) is reliant on the accuracy of sub models and hydrodynamic forces while the
Colorado State University model as modified by Nadal et al. (2010) is reliant on the geometric parameter of the structure.</dc:description>
