	<dc:description xml:lang="en">It is known that the tsunami is generated by the debris flow due to slope collapse into the sea. The huge waves may cause damage to coastal structures and residents. Because of heavy rain in northern parts of Kyushu Island, Japan, in July 2017, many reservoirs were damaged and were destroyed. It has been reported that the huge waves may have been caused by debris flow due to the heavy rain. Many laboratory experiments and numerical simulations of the landslide-generated tsunami into the sea have been carried out to clarify the process of wave generation. However, there are a few studies of wave generation by debris flow into a small area of water such as a reservoir. In this study, model experiments of debris flow were conducted in a two-dimensional flume and numerical models based on the depth-averaged shallow water equations have been per-formed in order to clarify the hydraulic characteristics of the waves.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/r6r72KtkvL4</dc:description>
