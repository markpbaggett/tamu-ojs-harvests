	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tests were made in CERC's Shore Processes Test Basin witlt wayes approaching the toe of a test beach at a 30-degree angle Beach material was quartz sand with median diameter of 0 22 millimeter which, in most tests, was molded to a 1 on 10 slope before starting a test Long crested waves generated in a constant depth of 2 33 feet traveled over the beach, shoaled and were refracted before breaking near the shoreline The breaking action caused the sand to be transported along the shore in the direction of the longshore component of the wave energy flux Transport rates of 2 to 170 cubic yards per day were measured, with the lower rate within the range of laboratory rates reported by Savage^and the higher rate comparable to field rates reported by Watts^for South Lake Worth Inlet, Florida Analysis includes correlation of the measured rates to the longshore wave energy flux, and in some tests, to the longshore current Transport rates, defined by visual fit curve of the data, are about 3 times the rates indicated by the CERC TR-4 design curve for a longshore energy range of 0 016 to 0 760 millions of foot pounds per foot of shore per day.</dc:description>
