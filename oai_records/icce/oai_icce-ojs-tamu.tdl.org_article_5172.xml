	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Experiments on oxygenation due to breaking waves on a uniformly sloping beach and on an S - type breakwater were performed. The water was chemically deoxygenated and dissolved oxygen (D.O.) concentration was followed over time in characteristic locations. Experimental data showed that the transfer velocity increased with increasing wave height for waves of the same frequency. Experiments with waves of the same wave height but increasing wave frequency showed also an increase in transfer velocity. The breakwater data give lower transfer velocities as compared to the sloping beach data for the same wave characteristics. The one - dimensional transport equation was used for the determination of the transfer coefficients. Analysis of the data indicated that the transfer coefficients varied almost linearly with the vertical wave velocity at the water surface. A rather good linear correlation was obtained for the breaking wave data on the sloping beach, with much higher slope as compared to the case of non-breaking waves.</dc:description>
