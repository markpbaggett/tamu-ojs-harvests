	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper describes how a once popular pleasure beach became denuded by the abstraction of sand for industry and how, in more recent times, it was restored to its former levels. The history of the area has been studied in some detail, and it can be seen that the lowering of the beach caused progressive damage to the sea wall, eventually leading to flooding of some parts of the frontage. In the 1960's a parapet was added to certain sections of the sea wall, and local flooding was alleviated, but the lower parts of the wall and apron suffered continuously from wave attack and the situation deteriorated to an extent where complete reconstruction of the sea defenses had to be considered. It was shown that a scheme involving beach renourishment by the pumping of sand from offshore provided a more economical solution and the area now enjoys the amenities provided by the restored beach.</dc:description>
