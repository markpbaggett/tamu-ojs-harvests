This Proceedings contains more than 300 papers presented at the 27th International Conference on Coastal Engineering, which was held in Sydney, Australia, 16-21 July 2000. The Proceedings is divided into five parts: characteristics of coastal waves and currents; long period waves, storm surges and wave groups; coastal structures; coastal processes and sediment transport; and coastal, estuarine, and environmental problems. The individual papers include such topics as the effects of wind, waves, storms, and currents as well as the study of sedimentation, erosion, and beach nourishment. Special emphasis is given to case studies of completed engineering projects. With the inclusion of both theoretical and practical information, these papers provide the civil engineer and professionals in related fields with a broad range of information on coastal engineering and coastal processes affecting design and operations in the coastal zone.This Proceedings contains more than 300 papers presented at the 27th International Conference on Coastal Engineering, which was held in Sydney, Australia, 16-21 July 2000.
