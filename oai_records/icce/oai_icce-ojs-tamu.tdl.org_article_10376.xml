	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A marina for small crafts is being planned to be built within Caliraya Lake situated at an elevation of 290m above Mean Sea Level (maMSL). Unlike sea-connected water bodies, the water level of Caliraya Lake is largely influenced not by tidal fluctuations, but by the operational water level requirements of the hydroelectric power plant that it caters to. Due to the large difference in the Normal High Water Level (NHWL) and Minimum Operating Level (MOL) of the lake of 2.5m, a floating pontoon marina with guide piles was contemplated to be used. The marina analysis and design approaches implemented in this study considered waves generated by prevailing winds and ship-generated wakes to assess the wave climate and tranquility within the marina. Since the project area is also frequently tracked by typhoons, wind- and pressure-driven storm surges were also used for the vertical siting of the guide piles. Lastly, based on the geographic appearances of the lake shoreline and with the small size of the lake, the fetch limitations resulted to very small wind-generated waves and wind setup considered as wind-driven storm surge components. In comparison to open seas where wind-driven storm surge accounts for approximately 95percent of the total storm surge, the wind-driven storm surge components for the potentially critical historical typhoons which traversed within 200-km radius of the project area only generated 10-30percent of the total storm surge considered for the vertical siting.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/m-XEEw6r99g</dc:description>
