	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) tsunami flow model was proposed in order to predict a 3D flow field around a harbor accurately when tsunami strikes. In the proposed numerical model, the Cartesian coordinate system was adopted, and the Fractional Area/Volume Obstacle Representation (FAVOR) method, which has the ability to impose boundary conditions smoothly at complex boundaries, was introduced into the governing equations in consideration of applying the estimation to actual harbors with complex shape in the future. Moreover, the fifth-order Weighted Essentially Non- Oscillatory (WENO) scheme, which is a technique for achieving high accuracy even if the calculation mesh is coarse, was applied to discretization of the convection terms of the governing equations. In order to verify the validity of the model, it was applied to a large-scale laboratory experiment with a scale model of harbor. Comparisons between the simulated and experimental results showed that the model was able to reproduce the time variation of the flow field with sufficient accuracy. Moreover, the simulated results showed that a complex 3D flow field with some vertical vortex flows was generated around a harbor when tsunami struck.</dc:description>
