	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A beach monitoring program between 1962 and 1972 at Atlantic City, New Jersey was designed to observe the response of beaches to waves and tides of specific intensity and duration as a first step in developing a storm warning system for low-lying coastal communities. As a by-product of that study the behavior of beach sand following two beach replenishment projects in 1963, and again in 1970, was determined. Monitoring was done using repetitive beach surveys above mean sea level (MSL) at seven profile lines. Survey results show that following replenishment, losses of the fill material above MSL were between nine and twelve times the losses measured in adjacent non-fill areas. Loss rates were largest at the updrift end of the fill region. About two and one-half times more material appeared to move in a seasonal on-offshore direction than moved permanently alongshore and above MSL to the southwest. For each meter of beach retreat, 5 to 6 m /lineal meter of fill were lost.</dc:description>
