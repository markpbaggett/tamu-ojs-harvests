	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The paper discusses the morphological development of the Venice Lagoon since 1850 and, on the basis of analyses of the system, presents models to simulate large scale development of the lagoon and of various sub-basins. The morphological development consists mainly in a continuous erosion of the saltmarshes and shallow areas, and a filling of canals. Also a general loss of sediment from the lagoon was observed. The main causes were identified in engineering structures like jetties, dredging of artificial canals and maintenance dredging. These works resulted in a disequilibrium of the natural hydraulic system. In addition, loss of biological protection in shallow areas, due to pollution, has contributed. Models were prepared on basis of time and partially averaged concentrations of sediment in shallow areas and canals. Averaging was carried on over a full year. This approach facilitated the building of models of various complexity, which were found to be useful tools in the analysis of the effectiveness of remedial measures .</dc:description>
