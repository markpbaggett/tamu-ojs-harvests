	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The elimination of land transportation costs for raw materials and/or industrialized products has encouraged integration of industrial and port activities and, at many ports, facilities are being built for the installation of industrial complexes adjacent to the port areas. This general trend has been clearly observed along the coast of the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, north of Rio de Janeiro. Several new port terminals, associated with industrial plants, are under construction or were designed recently. In fact, the State's port development began with its Commercial Port in Vitoria, located at the mouth of the Santa Maria river. The following terminals connected with industries were built at a later date: a) Tubarao Maritime Terminal, which was brought into operation in 1966, sited at the outer end of Espirito Santo Bay, 9 Km away from Vitoria, for iron ore exports. This terminal belongs to the stateowned Companhia Vale do Rio Doce - CVRD. Iron ore exports reached more than 50 milion ton per year during the last three years. b) Ubu Maritime Terminal, inaugurated in 1977 and sited in the south of the State, was designed for exporting pelletized iron ore produced by a plant sited in the port area. This plant receives its raw material (ore fines) through a pipeline approximately 400 Km long. These facilities belong to privately-owned SAMARCO Mineracao S.A., and will have a total export capacity of 7 million tons of pellets per year when it reaches it final expansion phase. c) Barra do Riacho Port, which should start operation in 1978, built by PORTOCEL (owned jointly by PORTOBRAS, Aracruz Celulose and CVRD) is intended to export wood chips and pulp produced at industrial facilities adjacent to the port. In addition to these terminals, there are plans to built other ports which will handle goods to be produced by industries now moving into Espirito Santo.</dc:description>
