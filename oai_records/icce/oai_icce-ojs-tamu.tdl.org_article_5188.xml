	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Due to the construction of Naoetsu harbor, severe beach erosion has taken place on the Joetsu-Ogata coast facing the Japan Sea. To establish a principal methodology for beach stabilization, large scale coastal behavior first is investigated by constructing a long-term shoreline change model in which the representative monsoon wave is introduced. Comparison of hindcast and actual long-term shoreline change shows that the proposed model can predict long-term shoreline change. Shoreline change after the construction of Naoetsu harbor also was predicted under the condition that natural sandy beaches had been retained. Results show that shoreline retreat is severe near the harbor and extends to the central part of the coast. To determine the most suitable location for headlands to be used for stabilizing the coast, long-term shoreline changes were calculated under the condition that a headland is given at several locations. We conclude that in principle when the boundary condition for shoreline change by headland is given near the Shinbori River, a sandy beach tends to have stable large scale coastal behavior during longterm shoreline change. We propose a principal methodology for beach stabilization, part of which is being used in current construction.</dc:description>
