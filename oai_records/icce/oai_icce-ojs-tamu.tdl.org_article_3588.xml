	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the present study the mooring systems of four bulk carriers which were moored at a jetty located parallel to a navigable water were investigated with special regard to forces due to passing ships. The objective of this study was to verify in praxi the present knowledge of moored vessels berthed at more protected sites and to prove proposed models of forcing functions by passing ships as well as numerical models for the computation of ship mooring systems. For that purpose the mooring forces and also those data which characterized the properties of the mooring systems were recorded. On the basis of the also recorded wind and current data and the data of the passing ships with which the external forces could be estimated the mooring forces were computed. These computed forces are compared with the measured mooring forces.</dc:description>
