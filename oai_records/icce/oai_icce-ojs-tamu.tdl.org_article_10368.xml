	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Disaster damage caused by tropical cyclone has grown every year. However, our experience of tropical cyclone is not enough to evaluate very low frequent and catastrophic disaster event. Stochastic tropical cyclone model has been used for assessment of tropical cyclone disaster. Global stochastic model was improved by using a lot of ensemble Global Climate Model simulation data (d4PDF) instead of limited number of observation data. The model bias included d4PDF was corrected by each regional grid by simple statistical method and interpolation. The accuracy of new model was verified at representative regional area in different basins. Generally, the improvement is remarkable where tropical cyclones rarely passed. The variation of joint PDF of tropical cyclone change rate between previous model and present model agree with model improvement. As an example of application, the frequencies of strong tropical cyclone events of two cases were estimated.</dc:description>
