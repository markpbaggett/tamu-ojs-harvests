	<dc:description xml:lang="en">As coastal communities worldwide contend with sea-level rise, coastal erosion, and other impacts of climate change, a critical piece of the puzzle has become educating stakeholders in highly creative, insightful, and practical ways. In this study, we will highlight the main findings from the use of immersive and interactive Virtual Reality (VR) experiences in climate adaptation. These tools are helping coastal communities better understand potential impacts as well as explore near- and long-term solutions to reduce coastal risks. We will describe the challenges and steps taken to develop these applications at four coastal locations in the U.S. (Turner Station, MD, and Santa Cruz, Long Beach, and Moss Landing in CA); from identifying key objectives of each experience, the critical messages, and target audiences, to flying drones over coastal areas and working with photogrammetry to create hyper-realistic 3D models that are inserted in the VR experience. These immersive and interactive experiences support planning, management and monitoring activities related to sea-level rise, storms, coastal erosion, king tides, and more. These tools are being developed by a multidisciplinary team with a range of expertise including climate and coastal scientists, city planners, communications experts, filmmakers, 3D animators, and VR developers.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/aDIkbn_FO1c</dc:description>
