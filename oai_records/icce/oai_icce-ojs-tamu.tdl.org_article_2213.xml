	<dc:description xml:lang="en">During the ten years from 1947 to 1956, typhoons with a maximum velocity of more than 34 knots have attacked Japan at an average of 26.8 times a year, inflicting damages amounting to 240 thousand million yen on the average each year (1946-1955) . However, depending on the course and scale of the typhoon and the season of the year, except for damages to vessels, in some cases, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages as the abundant ram fall resulting from a typhoon is beneficial to agriculture and hydraulic power generation widely developed throughout the country. In the past, damages from typhoons consisted of storm and flood disasters with the flooding of inland waterways and landslides in mountainous districts due to heavy precipitation. However, lately, with the rapid progress of modern industries, cities with ports and harbors are expanding with the development of large industrial zones along coastal areas where raw materials can be obtained from foreign countries at low cost of transportation, and vast areas of land for the establishment of industrial plants can be acquired without encountering serious obstacles through land reclamation along the shores. These circumstances have called for the necessity of protecting the coastal areas from the direct attack of high tides and wind waves generated by typhoon.</dc:description>
