	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Stockholm Conference, held in 1972, represents the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. The declaration presented at the end of the conference considered the need for principles to inspire and guide in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment. Past 50 years over this event, some analyses are demanded. Thus, based on Stockholm Conference main proclamation, this work aimed to present an evaluation of what was the Portuguese coastal management over the last five decades, highlighting what was done and what is still missing. The Stockholm Conference outputs pointed out the importance to preserve the environment. The Portuguese coastal management along the last 50 years experienced different strategies. Presently, it is evident the importance of monitoring, integrated studies, combining social, economic and environmental aspects, stakeholderâ€™s involvement, education and dissemination. However, Portuguese coastal areas still face multiple environmental challenges and conflicts, which continuously demand for an adequate coastal management, looking for a sustainable future.</dc:description>
