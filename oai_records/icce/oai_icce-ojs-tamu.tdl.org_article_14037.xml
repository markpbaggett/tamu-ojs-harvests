	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Extremely large waves, also known as freak waves or rogue waves, are defined as H greater than  2Hs, where Hs is the significant wave height, H is the wave height (Dysthe et al., 2008). These waves have caused great damage to marine structures and human life in open seas and coastal regions. Many studies have demonstrated that an extreme wave evolve from a wave group in random wave trains. Shapes of extreme wave groups are strongly related to dynamic responses of structures. NewWave is a common theory to reflect the average shape of freak wave groups in the Gaussian process (Tromans et al., 1991). However, the differences of profiles based on the theory and measured time series have not been quantified in detail. In the paper, 1424 freak waves from various sea states in the Norwegian Sea are analyzed and their average wave shapes in each class of sea states are compared with those according to the theory, it is found that as the wave steepness is less than 0.08 and the spectral width parameter is smaller than 0.36, the NewWave theory can reflect mean extreme wave shapes rationally, whereas, for the sea states with the larger wave steepness or wider ocean spectrum, the energy of freak wave groups are obviously underestimated.         </dc:description>
