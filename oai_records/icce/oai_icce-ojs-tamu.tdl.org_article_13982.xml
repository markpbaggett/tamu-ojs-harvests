	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Wave attenuation datasets were collected from four constructed oyster reef (COR) fields sites across New Jersey and Connecticut. The sites span a diverse range of techniques used in practice including oyster castles, gabion baskets, and reef balls. All sites are submerged for part of or all of the tidal cycle to promote oyster recruitment. While submerged, wave amplification was observed at all four sites. COR are designed under the dual mandate of habitat creation and wave attenuation to reduce marsh edge erosion. However, the consensus in leading literature is marsh edge erosion is related to the energy flux, not wave height alone. Inspired by this and laboratory investigations of wave height amplification in the energy spectrum, the field data is analyzed to compare the transmission of wave height and energy flux through the COR. It was found that when wave heights were amplified, wave energy flux decreased 46percent of the time. In the most extreme case, energy flux transmission showed a 48percent reduction while wave height transmission showed a 135percent increase. Under conventional design approaches using wave height transmission alone, the COR exhibiting wave amplification would be considered a design failure from the wave attenuation standpoint. This highlights the limitations of wave height transmission analysis in quantifying the performance of submerged shore protection structures. It is suggested that wave energy flux and wave energy flux transmission provides a more complete metric for design and evaluation of CORs.</dc:description>
