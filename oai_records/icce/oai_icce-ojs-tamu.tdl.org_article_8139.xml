	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Potential areas for tidal stream energy development are conventionally selected on the basis of resource assessments. For all the importance of the resource, there are other elements (technological, economic, spatial, etc.) that must be taken into account in this selection. The objective of the present work is to develop a new methodology to select tidal stream hotspots accounting for all these relevant elements, and to apply it to a case study, showing in the process how the potential for tidal energy development can be fundamentally altered by technological, economic and spatial constraints. The case study is conducted in the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary (UK), one of the regions with the largest tidal resource in the world. First, the most energetic areas are identified by means of a hydrodynamics model, calibrated and validated with field data. Second, the method calculates the energy that can be harnessed in these areas by means of a geospatial Matlab-based program designed ad hoc, and on the basis of the power curve and dimensions of a specific tidal turbine. Third, the spatial distribution of the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) is calculated, and a number of locations are selected as potential tidal sites. The fourth element in the approach is the consideration of restrictions due to overlap with other marine uses, such as shipping. As a result, potential conflict-free areas for tidal stream energy exploitation at an economical cost are identified. Thus, the case study illustrates this holistic approach to selecting tidal stream sites and the importance of elements other than the resource, which - for all its relevance - is shown to not guarantee by itself the potential for tidal stream energy development.</dc:description>
