	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Along the west coast of Jutland, Denmark, from Lodbjerg in the north to Nymindegab in the south, is a 110 kilometre-long stretch of naturally retreating coastline. The coast is characterised by a gently sloping profile of sandy material with alongshore bar systems. The inner coastal plain often contains a few smaller coastal bars, and one larger breaking bar separating the inner and outer coastal plain. A sediment volume of over 4 million m3 is transported away from the area annually. The purpose of this study is to analyze the evolution the active coastal profile over time and in relation to the sand nourishments that have taken place along the Danish west coast from Lodbjerg to Nymindegab. The aim is to form a basis for assessing the long-term effect of the sand nourishments, as well as assess the needs for future nourishment efforts. There will be a special focus on the long-term effect of shoreface nourishments to assess whether the current distribution of 60/40 between shoreface and beach nourishment, respectively, can be shifted to a higher percentage of shoreface nourishment. If this is possible, the costs of the nourishments can be reduced significantly. </dc:description>
