	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper is a factual account of studies carried out for the design of a new deep water harbour As so often happens construction work had to be begun before many of the conclusions of the study were available so that alterations to the initial designs had to be made while work progressed The studies comprised tidal and wave recordings and analysis, model studies to determine residual wave conditions at the quays, studies to determine the extent of littoral drift, the effect of the proposed works upon this and possible measures to counter downdrift erosion In addition studies were made of the stability of the adjacent creek channel which had previously been the harbour and a mathematical model study was carried out of the effects on the creek regime of various proposed entrance works including the construction of an entirely new creek entrance channel through the new deep water harbor.</dc:description>
