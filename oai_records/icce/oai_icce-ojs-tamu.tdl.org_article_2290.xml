	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Dutch coast is over its whole length a sandy coast* Along such a coast the changes in shape of the coast-line are determined by transport of sediments, in oasu sand, along the coast. This transport is brought about by water and by air. The latter, the eolian transport, though it may here some importance, has been neglected in this study* The marine transport along the Dutch coast is caused by currents and by waves; we do not know which is the most important. In this study the transport by waves is considered to be the effect of waves, moving in one predominant direction; the transport by currents is taken into aooount as a transport by tidal currents only. We should like to underline her* the very general character of the following considerations.</dc:description>
