	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The paper discusses the problems associated with the loss of coastal resources, which is often the result of applying traditional coast protection measures in densely developed areas. It is recommended to distinguish clearly between coast protection, as measures mainly securing the coastline, and shore protection, as measures protecting also the shore and the natural coastal resources. The planning concepts Shoreline Management Planning and Management Unit Master Planning have been discussed, in which connection the importance of obtaining broad consensus for a management strategy and for cost sharing has been highlighted. The importance of preserving the coastal resources by working with the nature has been illustrated and innovative shoreline protection principles have been proposed for different types of coastal classifications. New types of environmentally optimised coastal structures have been proposed and an overall comparison of various protection measures has been made.</dc:description>
