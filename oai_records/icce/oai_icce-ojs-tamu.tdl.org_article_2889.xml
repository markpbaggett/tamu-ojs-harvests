	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In the coastal regions of the North- and Baltic-Seas of Germany more collisions with oil tankers have occured since 1955. These collisions have been followed by extreme pollution of the sea and coastal areas. In the following report the possibility of computing in advance the time and place of the landing of sludge, the advantages and disadvantages of chemical and mechanical treatment for the removal of the oil, the natural influences on the decomposition of the oil and the differences between oil pollution on coasts with tides and on coasts without tides are explained and critizised. Coastal areas and beaches are in danger of being polluted by oil. One part is the uncontrolled disposal of waste oil causing permanent pollution, the other part is the result of collisions with vessels. This danger is most threatening on much frequented shipping routes and in limited and relatively small sea-areas and bays of low depth, as it is the case with the North-and Baltic-Seas in the North of Europe.</dc:description>
