	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The concept of a stone revetment where rock movement is expected is relatively new. For people familiar with gravel and shingle beaches, the idea is an easily accepted extension of the traditional statically stable revetment. However, for engineers familiar with classic breakwater design, the idea that a dynamic structure can provide suitable shoreline protection raises many doubts. Recent research in the Netherlands by van der Meer (1988) and colleagues has gone a long way toward answering difficult questions regarding the development of sound design criteria for dynamic revetments. This paper discusses progress in quantifying the problem and defining solutions. Laboratory model tests were conducted at the Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC) to confirm and extend Dutch research. These tests are described and important findings presented, including a simple quantitative method to predict the amount of stone required to protect a bulkhead, i.e. critical mass. The method to protect a bulkhead appears to have more general implications which could lead to extensive application to a wide range of shoreline erosion problems. Analysis of data is continuing.</dc:description>
