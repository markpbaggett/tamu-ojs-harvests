	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The 33rd International Conference on Coastal Engineering (ICCE 2012) was held in Santander, Spain, 1 July to 6 July 2012.  The Local Organizing Committee, led by Iñigo J. Losada and Raúl Medina, is acknowledged for their dedicated preparation over many years that led to a successful conference with broad participation.  Eight-hundred attendees from 45 countries gathered at the Santander Convention Center to discuss research and applications in coastal engineering.  The papers contained in this Proceedings cover a wide range of topics including waves; swash, nearshore currents, and long waves; coastal management, risk, and environmental restoration; sediment transport and morphology; and coastal structures.  The authors have provided state-of-the-art contributions, and this volume could not be produced without their commitment to solving coastal engineering challenges.  The members of the ASCE/COPRI Coastal Engineering Research Council (CERC) and the ICCE 2012 Technical Review Committee reviewed 877 abstracts and selected the 524 paper and 110 posters that were presented at the conference.  The dedication of the Council members has led to the continued high quality and popularity of the International Conference on Coastal Engineering. Preparation of these proceedings would not be possible without the assistance of many colleagues.  Thank you to Prof. Robert A. Dalrymple, CERC Chairman, and Prof. Billy L. Edge, CERC Vice Chairman, for their guidance and encouragement.  Additional thanks go to Iñigo J. Losada for answering our many requests for information and for his gracious hospitality in Santander.</dc:description>
