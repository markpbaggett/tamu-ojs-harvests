	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The potential error of estimating the small pressure gradient under a directional wave field through the subtraction or comparison of relatively large total-head signals from adjacent pressure transducers in an array is avoided through the use of differential pressure transducers which measure directly the pressure gradients. A device which utilizes four differential pressure tranducers placed orthogonally about one absolute pressure transducer, (the "DPG"), was developed and field-tested at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Coastal Engineering Research Center Field Research Facility, Duck, North Carolina. The first five directional Fourier coefficients of the directional ocean spectra were developed from the DPG data, and although no other in_ situ directional wave monitors were available for comparison, the directional peak determined from the DPG agreed well with simultaneous High Frequency (HF) radar data. The DPG instrument is about one-half the size and less than one-sixth the weight of conventional pressure sensor arrays. The field establishment of the orientation of directional-measuring instruments is also discussed.</dc:description>
