	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this paper is to discuss the new manual titled Small Craft Harbors: Design, Construction and Operation, published by the D. S. Army Corps of Engineers Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC) as Special Report No. 2 dated December 1974. The objective of the manual is to enable anyone with a basic engineering background to plan and design small craft harbors or do so with the help of one or more specialists. The manual outlines methods of investigating the problems involved and the various engineering, economic and environmental criteria to be applied. It covers much of the planning and design considerations discussed by the A.S.C.E. Committee on Small Craft Harbors in manuals and reports on engineering practice, #50, "Report on Small Craft Harbors 1969". However, it also incorporates a considerable amount of additional information in the form of special design and construction techniques, certain rules of thumb commonly accepted in marina design practice, and observations as to elements of good practice in this field. It provides a compendium of planning data gleaned through a nationwide canvassing of marina operators, marina design engineers, and trades people who provide commonly used marina construction products. Also included in the manual are some of the design and construction requirements of various Federal, state and local government agencies having jurisdiction over, or assisting with the development of small craft harbors.</dc:description>
