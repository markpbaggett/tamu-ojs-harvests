	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Folly Beach is an island, nearly 10 km long, south of the entrance to Charleston Harbor. A large beach nourishment plan was planned and conducted to counter the large erosion rates the Island has suffered  for several decades. Because of the limitation on operations dictated by the turtle nesting season in the local area, it was required that all construction be completed in one season and extending from November 1 until May IS, 1993. During the construction of the Project, which included 1,908,000 m3 of material, two very significant winter storms caused some loss of material to the offshore and some damage to the pipeline system. The majority of the material moved by the storm has either migrated bach onto the beach or stabilized in a lower part of the subaqueous profile. The success of the first phase of construction of this 50 year project is in many ways attributed to the excellent working relationship between the City of Folly Beach, the Charleston District of the Corps of Engineers and the contractor. The long term success of the project will depend upon the frequency and severity of the storms which attack the project.</dc:description>
