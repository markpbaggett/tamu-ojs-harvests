	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The energy in waves which impinge on a porous structure, such as a rubblemound breakwater, is divided into reflected energy, transmitted energy, and the energy dissipated by turbulence within the structure. To obtain information on the reliability of using models to predict the transmission of wave energy through a rubble medium, a series of three models were constructed and tested in the 1 ft. by 3 ft. by 106 ft. wave channel at the University of California. The models consisted of rectangular, vertical-faced, wire baskets (constructed of expanded metal lath) which were filled with crushed stone. The three models were 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 ft. in length, respectively. All models were 1 ft. wide and 3 ft. high. Each structure was installed in turn in the wave channel and subjected to wave action with the wave height being measured both seaward (H ) and leeward (Hp) by resistance-type wave gages.</dc:description>
