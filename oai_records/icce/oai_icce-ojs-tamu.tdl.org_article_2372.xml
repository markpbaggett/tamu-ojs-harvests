	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper is addressed to the problem of structural behavior in an offshore environment, and the application of a more rigorous analysis for time-dependent forces than is currently used. Design of pile supported structures subjected to wave forces has, in the past, been treated in two parts; (1) a static analysis based on the loading of a single wave, and (2) a dynamic analysis which sought to determine the resonant frequency by assuming that the structure could be approximated as a single-degree-of-freedom system. (Ref. 4 and 6) The behavior of these structures would be better understood if the dynamic nature of the loading and the many degrees of freedom of the system were included. A structure which is built in the open ocean is subjected to periodic forces due to wind, waves, floating objects, and due occasionally to machinery mounted on the structure. To resist motion, the structure relies on the stiffness of the elements from which it is built and the restraints of the ocean bottom into which the supporting legs are driven.</dc:description>
