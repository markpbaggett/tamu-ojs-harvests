	<dc:description xml:lang="en">UAVs have been considered as one of the most powerful tools for coastal monitoring. 3D Topography of sandy beaches can be obtained with automatic flight of single UAV and 3D shape reconstruction technique. Furthermore, UAVs have been utilized for wave monitoring (Holman et al., 2017) as the video images or a series of still images from aerial cameras enable us to observe wave propagations from higher viewpoints. Although there are some proposed techniques to extract wave celerity and direction from the aerial images by UAV, there doesn't seem to be enough trials to obtain wave height, which is one of the most important parameters to consider coastal problems such as beach morphological changes. In this study, stereo image analysis for 3D shape reconstruction was applied to stereo image pairs by two UAVs as a test of the applicability of the existing stereo measurement technique and also possibility of 3D wave deformation measurement in field.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/QZBAwj5RIi4</dc:description>
