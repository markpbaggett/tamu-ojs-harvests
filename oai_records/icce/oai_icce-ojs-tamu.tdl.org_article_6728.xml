	<dc:description xml:lang="en">As waves propagate from deep into shallow waters, they begin to interact with the sea floor and undergo through several changes due to non-linear effects. These interactions cause the waves to transform and become non-linear as they decelerate and finally break. These local nonlinearities are reflected on the near-bed oscillatory flow and are inextricably linked to sediment transport, causing erosion-accretion patterns and bar migration. In this work the ability of a practical transport model that includes the effects of velocity and acceleration skewness in the time-varying bed shear stress (Abreu et al., 2011) is assessed to predict sediment transport rates under oscillatory flows and currents. The results are compared with two different data sets obtained under sheet flow conditions, showing a good agreement with the measurements. Moreover, its performance to the undertow and to non-linear characteristics is further assessed.  The practical sediment transport model is coupled to a simple bed-evolution model, enabling to evidence the relative strength of mechanisms associated with the wave and current induced sand transports. The results show that the formation of the bar and its migration is affected by a new term introduced in the bed shear stress predictor. This time-varying term accounts for the shape of the wave and is described through two non-linear parameters recently proposed in Abreu et al. (2010).This work provides further insights in the correct prediction of sediment transport modeling and sandbar developments, due to the combined influence of non-linear waves with undertow currents.</dc:description>
