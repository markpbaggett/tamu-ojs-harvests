	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Physical model tests were carried out aiming to provide information on armor stone movements in a berm breakwaters. The following items were examined: displacement threshold, frequency and length of stone displacements. Data were obtained from the observation of cumulative displacements at the end of each wave attack and from video records during the attacks; basic statistical analysis was performed. Threshold conditions, moving frequency and cumulative displacements are expressed as function of a modified mobility number, as stone mobility increases with both wave height and wave period. Information on mobility and displacement is eventually used to estimate longshore transport and abrasion. The longshore model is based on the assumption that stones move during up- and down-rush in the direction of incident and reflected waves; the model compares favourably with experimental existing results. The abrasion model is based on a proportionality assumption between abrasion volume and abrasion work; the proportionality coefficient characterizing the stone material resistance to abrasion is derived from Latham and Poole mill abrasion tests.</dc:description>
