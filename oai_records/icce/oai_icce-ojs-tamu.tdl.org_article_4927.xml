	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Nile Delta coast is a dynamic system formed by the Nile River sediments discharged into the Mediterranean Sea through the historic seven branches of the Nile. The central headland at Burullus began to erode around the 10th century upon abandonment of the old Nile branch which had been providing sediment to this area. Commencing in the early 20th century the nine barrages along the main river were constructed which initiated a general erosional trend along the Nile Delta with concentrations around the Rosetta and Damietta promontories. This alarming erosion has been aggravated since the erection of the Aswan High Dam in 1964, which trapped essentially all of the flood sediments in its storage basin. Eighty beach profiles, covering the Delta coast, have been surveyed twice per year since 1976 and surveying is continuing to the present. A computer program was developed to analyze the collected profile data. This program calculates the accretion/erosion quantities and the movement of various contour lines up to 6 meters depth. The results have shown that the changes do not follow a clear pattern except at the Rosetta and Damietta promontories and around the El Burullus area where consistent erosion is evident.</dc:description>
