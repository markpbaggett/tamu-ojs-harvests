	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A one-dimensional numerical model of a 340 mile section of the St. Lawrence River has been formulated to study tidal propagation. For a more detailed study of the flow distribution in a localised section of the river a two-dimensional model was used. A half mile square grid was used to schematise an area of approximately 20 miles long by 15 miles wide. This two-dimensional model was embodied within the one-dimensional model to permit a free interaction of flow across the boundaries. For the one-dimensional case, a comparison of model and prototype results is included for both elevation and velocity. For the two-dimensional model a comparison of flow distribution was made by using field results obtained from photographing ice movement and from drogue movement. To interpret the results of the two-dimensional model into a simple method of flow visualisation, use was made of animation techniques. A movie film was made that demonstrates both tidal rise and fall and the associated horizontal velocities. Elevation was reproduced by use of varying shades of coloured paper to simulate contours, velocities were represented by simulating drogue movement to produce smoke streaks.</dc:description>
