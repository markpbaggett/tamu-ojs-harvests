	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Reliable, cost efficient, and continuous observations of nearshore hydrodynamics are often required for the design and maintenance of coastal structures as well as to understand coastal change. In the last decades, advances in digitization and computational efficiency for signal processing have led to an increased use of marine radars as a tool for hydrographic applications, such as the retrieval of bathymetry, surface currents, winds and sea state. Many marine radar products are based on a three dimensional fast Fourier transformation (3D-FFT) of the image sequences obtained from a scanning radar. These methods have been extensively validated in deep to intermediate water depths. In the nearshore, and increasingly shallow waters, validation studies are rare and the available studies mainly focus on the retrieval of bathymetry. Validated radar measurements of spatially varying wave and current fields are not yet available. The present study is thus focussed on the assessment of the limitations of radar hydrography in a nearshore environment.</dc:description>
