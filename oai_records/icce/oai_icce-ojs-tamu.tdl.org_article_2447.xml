	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This paper is concerned with certain field investigations and model experiments whose purpose was both to discover the mechanism of the movement of coastal material and its deposition m harbor basins and to consider some protective measures which might be taken against the fillmg-up of basins by drifting sand. From view point of similarity for the falling velocity of bottom materials, vinyl pellets were used as the model sediment. In experiments the height of the deposition of sediment was measured, together with the direction and velocity of currents, while m various cases the wave height inside and outside the harbor was measured as a means of elucidating the behavior of drifting sand as it fills up a hart or basin. It is concluded from these experiments that the fillmg-up of a harbor basin can be reproduced quantitatively in a model and that currents induced in basins by waves and harbor oscillations may have an important bearing on the problem of fillmg-up.</dc:description>
