	<dc:description xml:lang="en">It is feared that as a consequence of the potential future intensification of tropical cyclones due to ongoing climate change the patterns of coastal erosion around the world could change. In this study, the mesoscale meteorological model WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting), the third-generation stand-alone wave model SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore), and the coastal deformation model XBeach (eXtreme Beach behavior) are combined to calculate the short-term coastal deformation caused by high waves during the approach of Typhoon No.21 (Paolo) in 2017 to the Seisho Coast and Niigata Coast in Japan (Nishida and Shibayama, 2020). The model is then applied to predict future patterns of coastal erosion. Potential countermeasures to prevent future coastal erosion are then examined. The construction of detached breakwaters, which are currently used as a countermeasure against coastal erosion in many parts of the world, is often opposed by local residents due to the changes they can produce on the fishing environment and landscape. Therefore, it is often desirable to stabilize the beach without constructing structures offshore. Thus, gravel nourishment is proposed as a countermeasure against the short-term erosion that can be caused high waves, and its benefits and impacts were verified through numerical simulations.</dc:description>
