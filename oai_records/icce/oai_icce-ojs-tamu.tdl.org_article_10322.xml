	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Throughout history, coastal settlers have had to adapt to periodic coastal flooding. However, as a society we have become increasingly vulnerable to extreme water level events as our cities and our patterns of coastal development become more intricate, populated and interdependent. In addition to this, there is now a real and growing concern about rising sea levels. Accurate estimates of extreme water levels are therefore critical for coastal planning and emergency planning and response. The occurrence of extreme water levels along low-lying, highly populated and/or developed coastlines can lead to considerable loss of life and billions of dollars of damage to coastal infrastructure. Therefore, it is vitally important that the exceedance probabilities of extreme water levels be accurately evaluated to inform risk-based flood management, engineering and future land-use planning. This objectives of this study was to estimate present day extreme sea level exceedance probabilities due to combination of storm surges, tides and mean sea level (including wind-waves) around the coastline of Australia.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/vGaB85VRujs</dc:description>
