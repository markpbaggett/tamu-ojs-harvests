	<dc:description xml:lang="en">When, in the previous Conference, a paper was presented and published (l) aboarding the problems and solutions in a ria of the West End of the Spanish Cantabrian coast, the works of the solution project had just been finished (JUN 1988), so that very few data had been obtained about their behaviour. Aditionally, the systematic survey of the dynamics in the ria had been initiated but not finished, not even in the field data collecting, therefore the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic jp.odel obtained to implement the project, having explained rather satisfactory all the known coastal and estuary process and changes, only was a qualitative aproximation. Nevertheless it was in agreement with a very complete methodology of coastal processes analysis (2) and good enough to justify some singular circunstances: one of them refers to the increasing sandy filling of the ria what, like in all Cantabrian ones and probably like in many other bights -glaciars, like in New England, U.S.A., and Scotland, or structural, like in the rest of the Cantabrian and Bretagne (France),- has been principally filled with littoral materials, without any significant contribution of the respective rivers, whichever its size; other one, to the spit nature and genesis of the barriers of all the Cantabrian rias; they have been generated by the longshore transport through a "negative geometric singularity" (3) more than by onshore-offshore equilibrium and, consequently the migration of the tidal inlets is downdrift, but respect to the local drift, though it could appear to be updrift.</dc:description>
