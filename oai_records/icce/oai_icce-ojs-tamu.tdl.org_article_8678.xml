	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Understanding potentially extreme wave conditions during cyclonic events is essential for many coastal projects such as port planning, construction and coastline protection. For that purpose, numerical modeling techniques have been utilized efficiently to predict cyclonic wind and wave fields. In this study, cyclone Nargis (2008), which is the most severe cyclone in recorded history of Myanmar and its related wind generated waves (offshore and nearshore) are reproduced by using Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW, Skamarock et al., 2008) and Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN, a third-generation wave model developed at TU Delft). In fact, a number of studies have been conducted on simulating the cyclone Nargis and its subsequent storm surges (such as Raju et al., 2011 and Tasnim et al., 2015). By contrast, this research mainly focuses on configuration of wind waves caused by cyclone Nargis in order to understand the extreme wave figure at Myanmar coast during cyclone Nargis. The reliability and performance of the WRF-SWAN model is also checked. The model results are compared with observed data from different sources (JTWC, IMD, NOAA etc.).</dc:description>
