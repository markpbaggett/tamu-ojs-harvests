	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The XblocPlus is a new type of interlocking single layer armour units that is placed with uniform orientation. This is novel and different from all other single layer, interlocking armouring systems. The hydraulic stability of the XblocPlus breakwater armour unit was tested in 2D and 3D hydraulic model tests. Wave overtopping tests were performed to determine the roughness coefficients of the EurOtop overtopping formula for the XblocPlus. Model tests on a rubble mound breakwater with XblocPlus armour included 2D tests with a 1:30 seabed slope and with 1:2 and 3:4 breakwater slopes and 3D model tests with a flat seabed and with a 3:4 breakwater slope. Wave heights up to 150% of the design wave height were tested in the 2D tests and up to 200% with wave directions 0° to 60° in the 3D tests. No armour unit displacements were observed in 2D tests with 1:2 slope. In the 2D tests with 3:4 slope one armour unit was displaced when the wave height reached 159% of the design wave height. No damage to the XblocPlus armour layer was observed in the 3D tests. A roughness coefficient of 0.45 was deduced from overtopping tests with wave heights of 60% to 100% of the design wave height. The model test results indicate little or no influence of wave steepness on XblocPlus stability and no adverse influence of wave obliquity while the seabed slope in front of the breakwater may have some impact on the XblocPlus armour layer stability.</dc:description>
