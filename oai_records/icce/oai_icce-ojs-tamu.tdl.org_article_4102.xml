	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this paper is to predict the physical and mechanical properties of deposits near the surface of the seabed by in-situ measurements of the wave-induced pore pressure. First, the wave-induced pressure both at the surface of the seabed and inside the seabed are examined by frequency analysis, to clarify the propagation characteristics of pressure in the seabed. Secondly, a theoretical equation which gives the relationship between pore pressure fluctuation and wave pressure fluctuation is proposed. Thirdly, the porosity of the seabed is predicted by the propagating characteristics of the pore pressure within the seabed based on the results of both the model tests by wave tank and the field measurements of the wave-induced pore pressure. Finally, by fitting the theoretical equation to the spectral ratio of the in-situ measured pore pressure fluctuation to wave pressure fluctuation, the bulk modulus of the seabed and the degree of saturation are predicted.</dc:description>
