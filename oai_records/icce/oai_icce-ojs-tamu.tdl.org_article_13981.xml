	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study proposes an advanced analytical framework for investigating soil behavior under hydraulic loading by establishing a coupled soil–water analysis that discretizes fluid flow using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and soil deformation using the Material Point Method (MPM). Numerical methods for coupled soil–water analysis can generally be classified into grid-based approaches (e.g., the Finite Element Method, FEM) and particle-based approaches (e.g., the Distinct Element Method, DEM). Grid-based approaches often encounter difficulties in dealing with large deformations and collapse phenomena, whereas particle-based approaches can be computationally expensive and may struggle to accurately capture seepage. To overcome these limitations, a coupled fluid–soil analysis model has been developed using MPM, an intermediate method that combines strengths from both grid- and particle-based techniques. The model has been applied to a two-dimensional consolidation and seepage problem. The results indicate that the proposed method can accurately reproduce large deformations and seepage—phenomena that pose challenges for traditional grid-based methods—while also aligning well with earlier findings from particle-based analyses.</dc:description>
