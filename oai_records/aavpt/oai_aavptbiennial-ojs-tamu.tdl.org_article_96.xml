	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Clinical pharmacology is a relatively new addition to medical science and is in its infancy in veterinary medicine. Clinical investigation has a rich heritage which extends back to Claude Bernard and Francois Magendie, but the pharmaceutical revolution of the past thirty years has fostered the development of clinical pharmacology as an organized discipline. The need was identified in England (Daniels, 1951; Hill, 195l), and the name clinical pharmacology was proposed by Harry Gold in the United States in 1952. Clinical pharmacology has developed rapidly as a discipline, and "units" have proliferated in medical centers around the world. The beneficial effect of this approach to medical education and clinical investigation has been remarkable.
Veterinarians, our patients and society would benefit from the emphasis on a rational and scientific approach to drug therapy which veterinary clinical pharmacology would provide. This paper defines veterinary clinical pharmacology and outlines the role of such a specialty in the academic veterinary medical setting.</dc:description>
