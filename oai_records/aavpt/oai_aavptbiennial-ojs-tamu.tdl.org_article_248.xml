	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I thank you all for dedicating this Sixth Symposium of the American Academy of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics to me. It makes me very happy to look around the room and see the faces of many long time friends. Some of you I taught as veterinary students and I was the mentor for several of you in your graduate programs. I have been associated with nearly all of you in the discipline of veterinary pharmacology. Our biennial symposia provide a focus for this fellowship that has developed over the years. There are few organizations that have the cohesiveness that we have and I am very proud of the Academy and what it has accomplished.
I would like to take this opportunity to expound my personal philosophy of veterinary pharmacology. Aspects of this philosophy are closely related to the early development of our Academy and are incorporated in our logo.</dc:description>
