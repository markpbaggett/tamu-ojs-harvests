	<dc:description xml:lang="en">We are living in an age of information. Today, the unprecedented rate at which new information is generated far exceeds the capacity of the human mind to assimilate all of these new facts and concepts. It has become increasingly more difficult and time consuming to remain current in one's specialty area, and this problem will continue to grow in the future. To avoid drowning in a sea of information it has become important to develop the tools and skills to manage large amounts of data. Efficient management involves the identification of information sources; selective acquisition of information which is scientifically valid and pertinent to the needs of the individual; elimination of information which is trivial, invalid or irrelevant; and integration of the information to yield new concepts and knowledge. This idea of sifting through vast amounts of data to arrive at meaningful information was probably best expressed by the physician William Osler who wrote: "The knowledge which a man can use is the only real knowledge, the only knowledge which has life and growth in it and converts itself into practical power. The rest hangs like dust about the brain or dries like raindrops off the stones (l)."</dc:description>
