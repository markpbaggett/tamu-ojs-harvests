	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Naturally occurring cardiomyopathy in dogs represents a unique disease for clinical drug trials. There are, however, some problems that represent confounding factors. We were involved in the initial clinical trial of the new positive inotrope milrinone. The patient sample identified for this study was selected from the cases of cardiopathy referred to 3 large university veterinary medical teaching hospitals. Classification of patients was based on the NYHA system of exercise tolerance, only NYHA class III patients were selected for study. The largest problem by far was selecting methods of evaluating drug effect. The initial and subsequent assessment of these patients was by owner and clinician subjective evaluation, semi-objective response to exercise, and quantitatively by M-mode echocardiography, and in some instances by hormone concentrations and blood gas determinations. Study design was dictated by the three basic questions asked. Does the drug have an effect (randomized complete block), can the effect of the drug be distinguished from placebo (blinded randomized changeover), and what is the duration of detectable effect of the drug (randomized complete block)? We allowed no concurrent cardiovascular therapy during this study other than dietary salt restriction. The results were interpreted in light of the desired degree of confidence in not making a type I error. Although these are not the only solutions to the problems that were encountered they did enable a study design that allowed conclusive evidence of the positive inotropic effect of milrinone in naturally occurring cardiomyopathy as well as the beneficial effect of the drug.</dc:description>
