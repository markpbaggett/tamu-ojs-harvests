	<dc:description xml:lang="en">"Most patients with cancer demonstrate resistance (insufficient clinical tumor response) to the first chemotherapeutic agent or agents they receive."
This rather pessimistic quotation of Robert K. Oldham forms the basis of this paper which briefly reviews the various bases of the apparent clinical resistance of cancers to drug therapy. This resistance is both the bane and the opportunity of all who are involved in cancer therapy.
Two general aspects of the problem of cancer cell resistance to drug therapy will be reviewed: firstly, a general discussion of the causes of tumor resistance to drug therapy and secondly, some examples of methods currently being tested to overcome this resistance.
Tumor resistance to chemotherapy can be the result of pharmacokinetic, cytokinetic or biochemical resistance. Pharmacokinetic and cytokinetic resistance are not traditionally viewed as being permanent since one can theoretically use a variety of techniques, such as regional therapy or dose scheduling, to overcome them. Conversely, biochemical resistance has frequently been viewed as permanent, but this view may be too gloomy, since novel ways of reversing this resistance are appearing in the literature on experimental chemotherapy.</dc:description>
