	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The design of clinical trials is a very broad topic encompassing virtually all of the statistical concepts of good experimental design as applied in medical research. This discussion will only attempt to provide a general review of the major concepts, particularly as they apply in animal drug testing. Readers interested in more detailed information can refer to a number of excellent textbooks available on the subject as well as a recently initiated periodical entitled “Controlled Clinical Trials, Design and Methods” which devotes a major portion of its contributed papers to this design area.
In general, remarks will be limited to the design phase of clinical trials and will not address the numerous statistical aspects and problems that arise during the data analysis phase of such studies. In addition, the discussion will focus on the simplest case of a controlled clinical trial involving two groups, a treatment group (receiving a new drug, surgical procedure, etc.) and a control group (receiving a placebo, standard reference drug or procedure, etc.). All of the concepts can be easily extended to multiple treatment group studies, although their application can become very complex.</dc:description>
