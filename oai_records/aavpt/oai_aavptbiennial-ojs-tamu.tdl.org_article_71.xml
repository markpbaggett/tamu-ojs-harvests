	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Veterinary Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (VAST) subcommittee has been active since 1993. Before VAST started developing veterinary-specific breakpoints, all susceptibility testing for bacteria isolated from animals used the human standards (M100).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Testing standards for bacteria isolated from animals were needed to provide the best guidance for drug selection, interpretation, and monitoring programs.&amp;nbsp; The latest edition of the published standard is the 5th edition (CLSI VET01, 2018).&amp;nbsp; The accompanying document published as a supplement (VET08) has tables with antimicrobial agents recommended for testing, interpretive categories and breakpoints, and quality control (QC) ranges.&amp;nbsp; The most recent version is in its 4th edition (CLSI VET08, 2018).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The VAST subcommittee has developed breakpoints for 186 drug-bug combinations.&amp;nbsp; Since 2015, there have been 41 new breakpoints with 34 of these developed by the Generic Drug Working Group (described below).&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
The mission of CLSI-VAST is to develop and promote performance standards, breakpoints, and interpretive categories for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria isolated from animals.&amp;nbsp; Participation in VAST is entirely voluntary.&amp;nbsp; Not all laboratories use CLSI standards.&amp;nbsp; However, it is the only global organization with published susceptibility testing standards for animals.&amp;nbsp; (The European veterinary subcommittee of EUCAST, VetCAST has not published any standards for interpretation at this time.)&amp;nbsp; If a laboratory does not adhere to a public standard such as CLSI, susceptibility testing interpretation may be inconsistent from laboratory to laboratory and between countries.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
All members of CLSI-VAST are volunteers.&amp;nbsp; The committee is composed of representatives from industry, microbiology laboratories, device manufacturers (susceptibility testing companies), government (regulatory), and professions (academia).&amp;nbsp; CLSI uses a consensus-driven process and open meetings to develop standards for testing.&amp;nbsp; The committee is continuously evaluating existing interpretive categories and breakpoints for refinement and revision.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</dc:description>
