	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The ability of the host to resist infection is a complex process that requires the immune system, serum components and phagocytic leukocytes. The blood leukocyte primarily responsible for the ingestion and destruction of invading microorganisms is the neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocyte (neutrophil). Neutrophils comprise approximately 60-70% of the total circulating leukocytes and possess a circulating half-life of 6-7 hours (1). The neutrophil is easily identified by its lobulated nucleus and characteristic granular-looking cytoplasm. The granular-appearance of the cytoplasm is due to the presence of many membrane bound granules that are known as the azurophil (primary) and specific (secondary) granules. These granules contain a variety of enzymes and proteins that are involved in the inactivation, digestion and elimination of ingested microorganisms (Table I). Ingestation (phagocytosis) of bacteria by neutrophils results in the activation of neutrophil oxidative metabolism and the production of potent, cytotoxic oxidants used to inactivate bacteria. This metabolic stimulation may be viewed as a double edge sword in that the elaboration of toxic, oxygen-derivedÂ· metabolites is essential for bactericidal activity but the release of these same cytotoxic oxidants into the extracellular milieu may result in severe damage to surrounding cells and tissues.
This discussion will focus on the oxidative mechanisms of neutrophil-mediated bactericidal and cytotoxic activities and review the antioxidant defense mechanisms available to cells and tissues for protection against oxidant insult.</dc:description>
