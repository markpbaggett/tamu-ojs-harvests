	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This past year, the National Academy of Sciences issued its report, Poultry Inspection: The Basis for a Risk-Assessment Approach. This report builds on two previous reports from the Academy which affect our Agency: An Evaluation of the Role of Microbiological Criteria for Foods and Food Ingredients; and Meat and Poultry Inspection: The Scientific Basis of the Nation's Program. These reports will have an impact on how FSIS conducts its business in the future. In general, these reports recommend a risk-assessment approach to evaluate public health hazards, the development of a risk model incorporating all stages in the food chain from pen to plate, the utilization of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach to control potential public health hazards, and, increased cooperation between FSIS and those agencies which deal with areas outside our jurisdiction that impact on the safety of meat and poultry products. The most recent report concluded that the present system of continuous inspection provides little opportunity to detect or control the most significant health risks associated with broiler chickens and recommended increased microbiological monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of processing systems.
This past year has seen increased public awareness to the potential for our nation's food supply to harbor organisms of public health concern. From recalls of dairy products, to newspaper and television features on poultry processing, consumers have become quite familiar with microorganisms such as Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella. This coverage has led to many uncomfortable moments for both the food industry and the agencies that regulate it. The increased media attention has led to increased Congressional interest in Agency activities. Last summer, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the United States Senate reviewed FSIS poultry inspection. Members of the Committee have since proposed mandating an inspection system that incorporates microbiological criteria. We have also been directed by Congress to analyze twice as many food microbiology samples this year as we did last year. These samples will be analyzed in the three laboratories of the Field Service Laboratories Division within the Science Program. Developing the increasingly complex methods to test these samples and planning the programs to generate them is the responsibility of the Microbiology Division of the Science Program.</dc:description>
