	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Mequindox (MEQ) is a quinoxaline-N,N-dioxide antibiotic used in food-producing animals in China. MEQ residue in animal-derived foods is a food safety concern. To establish a quantitative model to simulate the disposition of MEQ and its marker residue 1,4-bisdesoxymequindox (M1), a flow-limited physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed in swine. Residue depletion data were collected in swine exposed to MEQ via oral gavage (10 mg/kg) or intramuscular (IM) administration (5 mg/kg) twice daily for 3 consecutive days. The model was calibrated with oral exposure dataset, extrapolated to simulate IM exposure, and further evaluated with published independent data. The model predictions correlated with available swine data well, including M1 concentrations in liver, kidney, muscle, fat and plasma. Monte Carlo analysis was applied to predict times needed for M1 concentrations to fall below the limit of detection (LOD, 5 Î¼g/kg) in the liver for the 99th percentile of the population, which were 32 and 34 days after the 3-day twice daily oral and IM administrations, respectively. This population PBPK model can be used to predict depletion kinetic profiles and tissue residues of MEQ and its marker residue M1 in swine, and as a foundation for scaling to other quinoxaline-N,N-dioxide antibiotics and to other animal species.</dc:description>
