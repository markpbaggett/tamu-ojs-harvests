	<dc:description xml:lang="en">I speak not as the voice of Veterinary Pharmacy -- rather, as merely one pharmacist who has worked for sixteen years in a veterinary teaching institution. In this capacity, I've had the privilege of interacting not only within the two professions, Pharmacy and Veterinary Medicine, but also with the drug industry, regulatory agencies, animal owners and producers. At the risk of sounding like a prophet of gloom, my reading of 'the signs of the times' reveals a drugged world -- human as well as animal. "Crime" and "madness" abound in the market place and many are being "down-trodden" and "wronged"! It is the challenge of this North American "Rome" that Veterinary Pharmacy must face.
But before explaining these observations and my answer to the "quo vadis?" question for Veterinary Pharmacy, it is imperative to review who we are, where we've been and where we are today.</dc:description>
