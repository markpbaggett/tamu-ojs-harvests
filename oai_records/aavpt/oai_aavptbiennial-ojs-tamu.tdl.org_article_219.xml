	<dc:description xml:lang="en">There are several factors which must be considered whenever drugs or other foreign substances are administered to an animal intended for human food. In all of medicine these considerations are unique to food producing animals. In the early years of our country, a spirit of adventure, exploration, and abandon prevailed. Animals were considered chattel and not subject to interference from anyone outside the farm. The philosophy was "they're my cattle, I'll do with them what I please".
More recently a different philosophy has emerged. The new public view is that food supplies are the public domain. The public would seem to tell the farmer that his cows are not really his unless he intends to consume them all himself. If he is going to sell animal products to the consumer, then the public has a great deal to say about how they are cared for, how they are fed, and what drugs they are given. A reverence has become established for animal food products.
Another unique feature of Food Animal Medicine is the herd implications. In poultry medicine, virtually no individual animals are treated. In swine and feedlot practice, the major emphasis in the use of drugs is on treatment of the herd. Because of the total value of the herd being medicated, the importance of the rationale for decisions is crucial. The stakes become substantially higher than with medication of individuals. This feature, combined with the high value of some individual food animals, makes pharmacology and therapeutics an extremely important part of food animal practice.
The teaching of therapeutics in the food animal sector requires special emphasis in two areas: 1) specific areas of pharmacology, such as the mammary gland and the rumen, which are unique to food producing species and 2) the regulatory, legal, political and ethical aspects which are important in all aspects of veterinary practice, but are particularly important to food animal practitioners.</dc:description>
