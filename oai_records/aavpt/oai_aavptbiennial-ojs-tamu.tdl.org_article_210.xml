	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The ability to develop and manufacture large quantities of peptide compounds in pure form is an exciting area of therapeutics for veterinary and human medicine. Up until now only a few relatively short peptides could be made by conventional chemical synthesis. Most peptides or proteins are made by extraction procedures from animal tissue which is costly and usually ends up with a mixture instead of a pure product.
However, this situation has changed dramatically with the advent of recombinant DNA biotechnology. We now have the potential to develop almost any peptide or protein in pure form in quantities which can be commercialized. Essentially, we can identify a natural protein that we want to make and then splice the genetic code from the appropriate animal species into a microorganism which then manufactures it in large quantities.
This kind of approach is quite different from the traditional approaches to drug development. With conventional technology, most Â· companies would screen thousands of compounds to discover which ones were biologically active and not toxic. Then they would try to find out what uses the compound may have. This is a very slow process and is part of the reason for the relatively few novel compounds that are eventually approved. In fact, may of the new compounds are chemical variations of already existing drugs that may offer increased efficacy, a decrease in toxic side effects or they circumvent resistance that has been developed by the host or infecting agent, such as bacteria and parasites.
With the advent of this biotechnology we can essentially reverse this process of drug development by first identifying problems or objectives and through our understanding of the basic physiological and biochemical mechanisms we can choose a natural or endogenous compound to effect a desired change. In most cases the endogenous compound is a protein that is normally present in only very small quantities. Thus, we already know the identity of the compound and that it is biologically active. The main challenge is to fully understand the body function that is to be inhibited, enhanced or changed and then to optimize that effect without creating a toxic response.</dc:description>
