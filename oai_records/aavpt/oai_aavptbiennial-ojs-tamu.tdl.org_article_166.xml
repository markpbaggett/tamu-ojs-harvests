	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The effectiveness of theophylline in the horse has been of questionable success in alleviating signs of respiratory distress due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There have been no studies in the horse that have correlated serum levels of theophylline with efficacy. However, in man the efficacy of theophylline, as determined by pulmonary function tests, has been shown to be well correlated with serum concentrations of theophylline ( 10-20 μg/ml effective range). Coupled with this narrow therapeutic range is the very low therapeutic index of theophylline, since adverse side effects occur at levels slightly above 20 μg/ml. Large fluctuations in serum concentrations do occur after multiple dosings in man and are the result of large interpatient variabilities in half-life (3-20 hrs with a mean of 7. 5 hrs in adults). Therefore, therapeutic monitoring of theophylline in man has been found to be essential to maintain effective blood levels and to avoid toxicity.
This study was designed to determine the basic pharmacokinetic parameters of theophylline (given as aminophylline) in horses following intravenous administration. Preliminary studies were performed in horses with reversible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to evaluate the efficacy of theophylline with known serum concentrations.</dc:description>
