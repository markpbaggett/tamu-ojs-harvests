	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In 1971, the fact of the emerging problem of drug residues in processed meats, the Food and Drug Administration, Bureau of Veterinary Medicine instituted extramural contract: research at the University of Illinois. Initial studies were designed to investigate the influence of dosing procedures, environmental factors and dosage forms on the kinetics of various antimicrobial agents commonly administered to swine, sheep and cattle. Preliminary trials designed to establish correlations between coexistent concentrations of these drugs in animals plasma and tissue were also included in the scope of work. By 1974 a linear correlation between the concentration of sulfamethazine in the plasma and tissues of sheep following intravenous and oral drug administration was demonstrated. At that time the scope of the research effort was expanded to study the feasability of using plasma concentrations of sulfonamides, tetracyclines, penicillins and the aminoglycoside antibiotics as a means of predicting coexistent concentrations of these drugs in animal tissues.
Pharmacokinetic modeling was chosen as the method of data analysis
because:

Mathematical relationships describing the behavior of the drug in plasma and urine could be established.
The model accurately describing drug behavior in plasma and urine could be tested (by means of slaughter studies) to determine if it predicted coexistent tissue concentrations.
Accurate estimates of the variability of drug behavior in the animal population could be established (a requisite if the model was used to establish residue withdrawal times).
The final, tested model could be used to predict coexistent concentrations of the drug in tissue if plasma data were available, regardless of the dosage form in which the drug was administered.
