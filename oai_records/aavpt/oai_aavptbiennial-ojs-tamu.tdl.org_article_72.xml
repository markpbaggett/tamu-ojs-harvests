	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the bacteria that have clinical importance in human and veterinary medicine has been considered as a worldwide emergency. Under the concept of One Health, international and national organizations have embraced a fight against AMR [5]. Passive and active surveillances are some of the most important components of these worldwide initiatives. CMLs provide antimicrobial susceptibility results as part of the passive surveillance data collection. Hence, the quality of AST results is very important not only for testing clinical cases but also for providing data to national and international AMR databases. Moreover, understanding how the phases of clinical diagnosis are affected by the decisions made by not only the diagnostician, but also by the clinicians would be helpful to excel AST use and interpretation. This document describes the phases that encompass the diagnostic testing cycle and clarifies how mistakes in these phases can generate errors in the process and interpretation of AST. In addition, the author presents how laboratories use the CLSI standards and the challenges faced by veterinary laboratories in properly implementing AST. The goal of this manuscript is to ensure that veterinary CDLs, pharmacologists, and clinical microbiologist understand the importance of AST for medical decision-making and as a tool in the urgent battle against AMR</dc:description>
