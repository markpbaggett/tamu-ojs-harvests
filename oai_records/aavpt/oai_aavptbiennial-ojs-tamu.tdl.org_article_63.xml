	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a mechanistic-based approach used to estimate drug residues in tissues and animal by-products and withdrawal intervals for food animals across species, age, sex, administration routes and doses. Traditional PBPK models are difficult to use by individuals with no modeling experience. Therefore, a user-friendly PBPK modeling framework and web-based interface would be beneficial. Penicillin G and flunixin meglumine are commonly used drugs for treating food animals and were among the top five violative drug residues identified by the U.S. National Residue Program from 2010-2018. The objective of this study was to establish a web-based user-friendly framework to develop PBPK models for drugs in food animals using penicillin G and flunixin meglumine as case studies. Traditional PBPK models for penicillin G and flunixin meglumine in market-age swine and cattle were developed and validated based on published data from the FARAD Comparative Pharmacokinetic Database1,2. The penicillin G model was extrapolated to dairy cows3 and heavy sows4. This traditional penicillin G model was converted to a web-based interactive PBPK (iPBPK) framework using R Shiny application. To test the applicability of this iPBPK framework, a new iPBPK model for flunixin meglumine in market-age swine and cattle was created5. These PBPK models can be used to predict withdrawal intervals of penicillin G and flunixin meglumine after extralabel administration to swine and cattle across production classes, administration routes and doses in real time. The iPBPK framework presents proof-of-concept for developing web-based iPBPK interfaces for withdrawal interval estimations and food safety assessment.</dc:description>
