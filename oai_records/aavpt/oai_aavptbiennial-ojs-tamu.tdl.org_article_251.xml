	<dc:description xml:lang="en">During the period between July 18, 1983 and July 22, 1985, it was my privilege and pleasure to serve as the fourth president of the American Academy of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics (AAVPT).
At our annual business meeting held in New York City in 1983, the importance of documenting AAVPTs history for posterity was among the many items discussed. Subsequently, the position of "Historian/Archivist" was created and Dario Cappucci, Jr. graciously assumed this important new area of responsibility for our organization. He soon established a firm working relationship with the History of Medicine Division of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland (HMD/NLM) and they agreed to accept and house a collection of materials relating to the history and activities of the AAVPT. This collection presently includes all of the issues of our Newsletter, AAVPT publications, photographs and other documents relating to the AAVPT since it was founded as the American College of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics in 1977. I am pleased that this relationship with HMD/NLM continues, and Dario Cappucci welcomes your input and continued support.</dc:description>
