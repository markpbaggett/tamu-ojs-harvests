	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The concept of correlation itself implies relationship. Most of the scientists are concerned with relationships among variables. Of course, our previous speakers have mentioned this. We are looking at experimental signs and people have started calling it statistics, also statistical science. However, there are a lot of other sciences known as experimental sciences and people include political science, sociology and economics among these. These concepts are also used in those sciences. I will give you some examples.
I will try to point out certain important relationships which have been proposed. The correlations, so called certain measures of correlations, have arisen over a period of years. It is enlightening to know that correlation concepts came very, very early. The earliest one is by Braves around 1846. The same thing is being used even today. What is this correlation?
If you have two random variables, x and y (2 measurements), the population correlation coefficient is a measure which is the ratio of the covariance to the product of the standard deviations. A quantity is created which is sort of unitless and this is one of the valuable things of this correlation—“x” may be anything in pounds, or “y” may be in terms of feet. You come out with a number which is unit free. Such numbers play an important role because you are completely out of the realm of measurement units.</dc:description>
