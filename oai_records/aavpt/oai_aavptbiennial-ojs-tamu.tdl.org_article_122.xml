	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The title of the talk suggests that there is a conflict between two possible statistical procedures. The conflict, if any, lies in the assumptions that two experimenters or statisticians are willing to make in the analysis of the data.
The decision on whether to use a parametric procedure or a nonparametric (distribution free) procedure depends on the assumptions in the model. In general, the more assumptions one can place in the model, the sharper will be the resulting inference. However, the more assumptions one makes in the model, the greater is the possibility that some of them may be wrong. For example, the assumption that Y is normal with variance 13.6 is more apt to be wrong than the assumption of normality only. Or the assumption of normality in each of two populations is more apt to be right than the assumption of normality in the populations and equality of the variances.
There has been considerable work done on evaluating procedures when the assumptions giving rise to them are incorrect. A procedure that works well even though the assumptions made are incorrect is termed robust. For example, it may be that in the problem of estimating the mean using procedures based on normality, the assumption of normality is not as stringent a requirement as one might suppose.</dc:description>
