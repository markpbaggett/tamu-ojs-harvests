	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The area of pharmacology dealing with animals living in the seas, oceans, lakes, and rivers of this planet is largely underdeveloped. Studies into this area are urgently required due to our increasing dependence on food from the sea, exemplified by growing aquaculture industries, and the changing environmental conditions of aquatic habitats, due to pollution, acid rain, etc.
The administration of drugs to fish and other aquatic species is complicated because of incomplete knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of drugs in these animals. It is also difficult to properly control drug delivery and bioavailability in an aquatic environment. Furthermore, the basic physiological processes of many species are incompletely understood and must be described prior to examining the pharmacology.
The present study has been initiated to understand the receptor populations of fish smooth muscle and how they are affected by environmental changes. The rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri was chosen because it is the major fish species farmed in the Maritime provinces of Canada and the gut chosen because of its ready accessibility. The study can be expanded to look at vascular smooth muscle as well.</dc:description>
