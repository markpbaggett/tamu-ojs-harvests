	<dc:title xml:lang="en">The Process of Tenure: The Effect on Women and Faculty Members of Color</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Marcano, Rosita L.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Tenure is perceived by many academics as the pinnacle of professional success. Gaining membership into this much-sought-after exclusive group so prized by faculty members on campuses around the world may be more of a hazing ritual than anything else. The abuse and torture sustained by many seeking tenure, including white males, is legendary. For some women and faculty members of color, the barriers to achieving tenure may be insurmountable.
The subject of tenure has been hotly debated in journals and the media for years. Most of the issues surrounding this debate focus on due process and academic freedom of academics, who are often judged by administrators who may have institutional perspectives that limit diversity and dissension.
What has been ignored is the prevailing, agonizing, and unfair process that tenure has become for women and faculty of color. It is a closed system where a few individuals can easily open gates, while making it unnecessarily harder for others, as the deciding committee sees fit. Too many of these committees are made up of tenured and promoted white males who are feeling the pressures of change around them. They are privileged within institutions of higher education and the tenure process has served them well. Although it may be difficult at times, the system works better for them than for other groups.</dc:description>
