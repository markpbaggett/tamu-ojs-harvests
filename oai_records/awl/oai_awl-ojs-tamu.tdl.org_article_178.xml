	<dc:description xml:lang="en">There are current inequalities in the representation of females in higher administrative positions in public schools that are a product of historical and societal patterns. These patterns have determined the constraints women have faced and continue to face when they attempt to enter public school administration. Women represent the majority in the teaching profession and in school administration graduate programs, but are persistently absent from the highest and most powerful administrative positions in public education (Shakeshaft, 1999). The top three administrative posts in public school education (superintendent, assistant superintendent, and high school principal) remain overwhelmingly filled by males (Keller, 1999). According to Mary Hatwood Futurell, former President of the National Education Association, in 2002 only 12 percent of the superintendents are women and just five percent are minorities (AAUW, 2002). This astounding figure is approximately the same as was reported at the turn of the last century.</dc:description>
