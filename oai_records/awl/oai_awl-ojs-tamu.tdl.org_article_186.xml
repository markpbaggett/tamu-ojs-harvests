	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Female Leaders in Educational Administration: Sabotage within our Own Ranks</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Professional women in Australia have an interesting term for what happens to talented and outspoken females who rise quickly in their fields. They call it the "tall poppy syndrome" because a poppy that grows higher than the rest often gets its head lopped off (Polley, 1996). Such a phenomenon also occurs with women who achieve success in the field of educational administration, "the blue flamers" (Funk, 2000), who rise quickly through the ranks but are often not supported and even sabotaged by other women who work with them. Many females in educational leadership positions in the United States experience a spectrum of types of negative treatment from female teachers to female superintendents that can be defined as horizontal violence--a term used here to describe the harm that some women do to other women in the educational workplace. An illustration of a non-supportive female, a Texas superintendent, was described by Skrla and Benestante (1998) who were spurned and summarily ignored by the female superintendent when they tried to give her brochures regarding the Texas Council of Women School Executives (TCWSE) at the annual superintendents' conference.</dc:description>
