	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Research on women's careers has been evolving over the last 50 years. Initially, research on men's careers was used to explain women's goals, barriers, and strategies; then White women's careers were used to explain all women's careers, regardless of race and ethnicity; finally, contemporary research breaks the homogenous, monolithic group of "women" into meaningful ethic groups. This study of 860 U.S. managerial women extends that research by comparing the career goals of White women, Black women, Asian women, and Latina women. Factor analyses show differences across all ethnic groups in how women strive for different career goals: contemporary goals (self-actualization and impact on the community), balance goals (claiming life outside of work), and conventional goals (measuring success by money and position). We offer explanations for the differences, directions for future research, and implications for women seeking leadership.</dc:description>
