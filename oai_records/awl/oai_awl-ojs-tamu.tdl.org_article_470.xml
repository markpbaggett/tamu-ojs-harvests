	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Dichotomy of Perception: An Analysis of Faculty Perspectives on Affirmative Action in the University of Missouri System</dc:title>

	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Discrimination in admissions and faculty employment has been a problem in academia throughout this nation’s history. The Civil Rights Movement led to political and legal remedies for this problem, among them anti-discrimination provisions in admissions (Title VI) and employment (Title VII), and affirmative action (Executive Order 11246), which all provided substantial gains for underrepresented groups in higher education (Travers &amp;amp; Rebore, 1995).
Long known as the “marketplace of ideas,” universities have in recent years had the reputation of providing equity for all students and faculty. Yet, affirmative action, a primary tool by which to promote equity in higher education, is being challenged in the courts and legislatures of states such as California, Texas, Florida, and Washington. In addition, this study was conducted at a time when the Missouri General Assembly was considering legislation, similar to initiatives in other states, which would “…abolish minority preferences in the State’s system of public employment, education, and contracting…” (Garnier, 1998).
This study examines faculty employment data to determine what it reveals about trends in faculty hiring based upon gender. This study also examines faculty perceptions of the impact of affirmative action on employment practices in the University of Missouri System.</dc:description>
