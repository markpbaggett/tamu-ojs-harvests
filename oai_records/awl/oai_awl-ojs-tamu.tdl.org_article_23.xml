	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Women in business are often confronted by work environments which influence career/leadership choices and family decisions, as noted in the recent New York Times article, "More Than Their Mothers, Young Women Plan Career Pauses" (Miller, 2015). Those in the millennial generation, born between the years 1981-1997, are learning by example from previous generations what career options they would like to pursue and not pursue. Although individuals in this generation may think differently than their predecessors, they may also fail to understand and take action on career, leadership, and family opportunities available to them. This research focuses on developing leadership skills and career awareness amongst students at a small liberal arts institution after business faculty noted a higher percentage of students intending to pursue careers as homemakers versus businesspeople. The program, focused on getting the conversation started at the college level to prepare students for the business world, was based upon the research presented in the book Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead by Sheryl Sandberg (2013) as well as the resources provided on the leanin.org website. The program exposed students, university faculty, and staff to female leaders at various stages in their careers through interactive, discussion-based sessions. Program developers also conducted empirical quantitative research on the student participants to identify changes in attitudes and behaviors as a result of participating in the program and found significant changes in student's ability to network and level of self-efficacy — issues addressed within the sessions. Significant differences were also noted between those choosing to participate in the program and a control group of non-participants. In addition, what initially began as a programming initiative to gain awareness around leaning in, or taking a more active leadership role, has since evolved to become a student-led effort that involves leaning out, such as working with others as mentors through collaboration with outside organizations. Keywords: leadership development, gender, women in business, mentoring. </dc:description>
