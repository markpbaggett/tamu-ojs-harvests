	<dc:title xml:lang="en">The Effect of Stereotype Threat on the Interview Performance of Women</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Shantz, Amanda</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">When women are in a situation whereby they are at risk of being judged by a negative stereotype, they underperform relative to men. This quandary is called stereotype threat. The present study examined whether stereotype threat affects the performance of men versus women in a simulated job interview. The stereotype that women are not suitable for managerial jobs was unobtrusively embedded in a job description presented to interviewees (n = 50) prior to the interview. The interviews were evaluated by four HR managers, two male and two female. The results showed that stereotype threat disadvantages females vis-Â -vis those in the control group, and it disadvantaged them relative to men in the stereotype threat condition. This occurred regardless of whether the HR manager was male or female</dc:description>
