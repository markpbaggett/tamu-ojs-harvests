	<dc:description xml:lang="en">When Title VII of the civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, it was applauded as a definitive step in controlling sexual discrimination. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provided further protection for employees and students in educational institutions. These forms of legislation were milestones in the growing movement for women's rights in education and the workplace (Random, Strasburg, &amp;amp; Lipman-Blumen, 1982). Progress was being made. Women were entering fields that historically had been closed to them. Women also were enjoying greater choice in determining the directions their professional lives would take.</dc:description>
