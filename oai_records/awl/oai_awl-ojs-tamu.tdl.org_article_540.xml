	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this study, we explored how women faculty at a Midwest Research University (MWU) experienced the promotion, tenure, and evaluation (PTE) process by applying an institutional ethnographic lens. Beginning from the standpoint of women faculty navigating the PTE process, we sought to identify the institutional policies, procedures and discourses that created challenges for women faculty related to caregiving and carereceiving work. Women focus group participants described feeling like they were at a disadvantage because they were experiencing additional pressure to take on caregiving work and that their carereceiving work was undervalued; participants reported conflicts between the work versus what they perceived to be required by PTE policy. We conclude with recommendations for policy changes and practices to support the paths of women faculty.
