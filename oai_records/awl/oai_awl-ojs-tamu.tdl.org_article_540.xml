	<dc:description xml:lang="en">In this institutional ethnography, we explored how women faculty members at a Midwest Research University (MWU)experienced the promotion and tenure evaluation (PTE) process through the lens of feminist standpoint theory. Beginning from the standpoint of women faculty navigating the PTE process, we employed institutional ethnographic methods first to identify the work of giving and receiving care among women academic workers. We then explored the institutional and organizational ruling relations that coordinated that work. Our findings consist of the disjunctures or conflicts between the day-to-day experiences and how women faculty interact with the institutional structures that coordinate their work. Women focus group participants described feeling like they were at a disadvantage because they were experiencing additional pressure to take on caregiving work, and that their care-receiving work was undervalued; participants reported conflicts between the work and what they perceived as required by organizational PTE policy. We conclude by calling for systemic support for faculty mentoring activities. We also recommend that for these changes to be lasting, recognition for mentoring activities be included in the Promotion and tenure evaluation (PTE) process with formalized measurement methods.
