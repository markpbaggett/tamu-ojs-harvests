	<dc:description xml:lang="en">More than in past years, females are enrolling in educational administration programs and aspiring to be to school principals, central office administrators, and superintendents. Efforts to increase the number of female employees by businesses, industries, and public agencies encourage women to work toward advanced degrees and apply for administrative positions typically regarded as male positions. Successful women are written about in newspaper articles and magazine features more often than ever before. These women leaders serve as role models to inspire other women to follow in their professional wake. Aburdene and Naisbitt (1992) write that "the women's movement has reached 'critical mass,' the point at which a trend becomes a megatrend." If this trend continues, opportunities for professional advancement and increased salaries for women will result.</dc:description>
