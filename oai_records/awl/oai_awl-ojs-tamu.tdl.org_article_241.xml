	<dc:title xml:lang="en">GRADUATE STUDENTS' DESCRIPTION OF THE IDEAL SCIENCE ADVISOR: IMPLICATIONS FOR GRADUATE WOMEN'S SUCCESS</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Ferreira, Maria M.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Research indicates that doctoral students' relationship with their advisor is the most important factor in the degree progress, and often the main reason for student attrition. In this study interviews with graduate students in two science departments, biology and chemistry, at a large research university were used to explore their concept of the "ideal" science research advisor and the extent to which their present advisor fits this ideal. Students' descriptions of the ideal research advisor included many of the traits that characterize the advisor as a mentor. However, student responses also indicated that most of their advisors deviated considerably from students' descriptions of the "ideal." This perception was particularly common among the female students in chemistry.</dc:description>
