	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Nigerian Women Leaders: Journeying Toward Organizational Rebirth Through Midwifery</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Hackney, Dr. Catherine E.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Twenty Nigerian women were purposely selected to participate in leadership development sessions because of their reputations as visionaries, cultural pioneers, and socially responsible leaders. They expressed that they sought to make differences in their organizations through greater leadership effectiveness; to change traditional thinking about women's leadership; and to challenge constructively the male organizational and traditional hegemony under which they worked on a daily basis. Together, for three days, these gifted women, my colleague, and I would be leader/learners enriched and instructed by the customs, traditions, and practices of each other.</dc:description>
