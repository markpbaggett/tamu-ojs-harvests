	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify and understand the career factors considered important for women working in leadership positions in the Paralympic Movement. This study relied on in-depth interviews and demographic information as the primary means of collecting data. Formal semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 participants who have worked in leadership positions in the Paralympic Movement for a minimum of 5 years. The three parts of the interview were (a) personal life history including demographics and career path, (b) career experiences including the most/least enjoyable and greatest challenges as a woman working in the Paralympic Movement, and (c) career aspirations and career advice. The results provide insight into the career challenges and work climate for women working in Paralympic sport.Keywords: Women , Paralympic sport, Social Role Theory</dc:description>
