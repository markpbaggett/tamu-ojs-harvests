	<dc:title xml:lang="en">The Road Less Traveled: Career Trajectories of Six Women Presidents in Higher Education</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Woollen, Susan</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Most research on the career pathways of women presidents has been dedicated to the traditional career path and the paucity of women in positions leading to a four-year college or university presidency. This leaves little research on women who achieved the position by following a nontraditional trajectory. This qualitative study explores the career trajectories of six women presidents who described their journeys to the highest leadership position as "nontraditional" or "unusual." Using Bateson's (1989) concepts of improvisation and adaption to examine their professional and personal experiences, the presidents unveil they were responsive to new opportunities, responsibilities, and challenges leading to their presidencies. Their backgrounds led them to develop an understanding and appreciation of institutional and organizational practices and cultures, community relations, campus relations, and a sensitivity to the importance of relationship building with an array of stakeholders. The study concludes by discussing the necessity of considering broader career frameworks to identify and increase the number of potential women candidates for the presidency. Keywords: women presidents, career trajectories, higher education, women's leadershipÂ </dc:description>
