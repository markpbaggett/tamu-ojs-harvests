	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Authentic Leadership: As Exemplified by Kamla Persad Bissessar- Implications for Current and Potential Leaders</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Bissessar, Dr. Charmaine</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The focus of this paper will be on the six seeds of authentic leadership as espoused by Cashman (2003) and the relationship to Kamla Persad Bissessar's leadership. Her strengths and weaknesses will be examined with a view to determining whether she displays qualities of an authentic leader. Speeches, e-mails, her facebook pages and the party's manifesto for 2010 will be used as touchstones to evaluate her level of authenticity as a leader. The six seeds are: (a) the need for leaders to manifest what is in their hearts, (b) ability to embrace both the good and the bad and learn from them, (c) the leader serves the parts and the whole through value creation, (d) the leader masters the ego and moves beyond the ego, (e) the leader displays social intelligence through his or her ability to connect with others, and (f) the leader is able to find the potential in others. A discussion ensues based on the example of authentic leadership and how potential and current leaders could capitalize on becoming more people-centered leaders.</dc:description>
