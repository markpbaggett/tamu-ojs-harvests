	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Segell, Dr. Glen M.</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Margaret Thatcher, the United Kingdom 's first female Prime Minister, moved to initiate policy that wouldsee gender equality in recruitment and pay in the armed forces, but not for pensions or combatant roles. In areview of the events and Thatcher's formulation of policy toward women in the armed forces, as a debate ongender equality and social justice, the salient variables and issues taken into consideration include:Thatcher's personal agenda; her ideological position; her policy priorities; her relations with womenorganizations; the domestic and international political situation in which she lived; and such concerns thatshe might have entertained, such as appearing to show favoritism toward other women or indeed appearingto be weak. Thatcher, the Member of Parliament, had preference to gender equality, though, once electedPrime Minister, prioritized pragmatism and patriotism due to circumstances.</dc:description>
