	<dc:description xml:lang="en">With the advent of educational accountability and the increase in job related stress, school districts are having a very difficult time getting and keeping quality public school administrators. Administrators across the country are finding themselves being pulled into a million directions. In some cases, administrators are facing each dilemma of the day alone â€” no assistant principal or key support to help with the stresses and strains they must face as leader of the phenomenon faced in schools. That same phenomenon has also had a great effect on university systems to produce quality administrators who "want" to serve in the leadership capacity. Not only are school districts scrambling to attract certified and qualified leaders, universities are redesigning their leadership programs to try to supply the demands of the public school settings.</dc:description>
