	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Gender and the Workplace: The Impact of Stereotype Threat on Self- Assessment of Management Skills of Female Business Students</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Flanagan, Jennifer</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Stereotype threat, the threat of being stereotyped against (Steele &amp;amp; Aronson, 1995), regardless of the legitimacy of the stereotype, can impact not only productivity, but goals, behavior, and ultimately attitudes. Stereotype threat impacts not only racial groups but men and women as well, each group impacted by the negative stereotypes about their intellectual and/or work performance. As the workplace becomes more and more diverse, managers must understand and brace for the impact stereotypes have on their workers. This study looks at the impact of stereotype threat on male and female business majors in the workplace and future entrepreneurs. The impact of stereotype was measured in their ranking of their own management skills, how they thought others would rank their management skills, and their goals in the workplace.</dc:description>
