	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The professional experiences and career advancement perceptions of Black, female, higher education professionals were examined in an effort to obtain qualitative and quantitative data that could positively impact practice and policy in higher education leadership. Data were collected using a mixed questionnaire that included survey items, open-ended questions, and demographic inquiries.&amp;nbsp; One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVAs) was conducted to assess the difference in mean perception career advancement scores based on participantsâ€™ professional classification, highest level of education, and years of professional experience.&amp;nbsp; No statistically significant differences (p &amp;gt; .05) were found.&amp;nbsp; The lack of differences across demographics indicates that Black, female, higher education professionals have similar perceptions of career advancement, regardless of professional classification, education achieved, or years of experience.</dc:description>
