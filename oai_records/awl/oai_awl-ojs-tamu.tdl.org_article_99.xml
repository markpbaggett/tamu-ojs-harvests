	<dc:description xml:lang="en">To understand the demographics of women sports medicine physicians and to determine whether they experienced gender disparity in the quality, quantity or types of clinical job opportunities. The authors surveyed women sports medicine physicians in the United States who were trained in one of the five primary care sports medicine specialties (pediatrics, emergency medicine, internal medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and family medicine). The participants completed the survey on the Internet and their participation was solicited via email based on membership in the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine or board certification with the American Board of Family Medicine. A total of 300 surveys were distributed; 182 surveys were completed for a response rate of 61%. Our study revealed that women over 35 years of age covered fewer events and games as part of their sports medicine practice than women under age 35 (75% versus 89% respectively). Only 25% of women under 35 and 41% over age 35 felt that they had achieved their career goals. In addition, 60.5% of the women surveyed felt that they were compensated at a rate commensurate with their male peers and most women stated that the type and amount of clinical opportunities for women did not differ from men. Overall, women sports medicine physicians were satisfied with their careers and most work in larger communities. However, it will be important to follow the careers of women sports medicine physicians in order to better understand the nuances of their clinical practice environments that may reveal disparities in the field of primary care sports medicine.</dc:description>
