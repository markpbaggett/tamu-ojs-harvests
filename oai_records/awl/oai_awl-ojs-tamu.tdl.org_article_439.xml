	<dc:description xml:lang="en">To overcome barriers to leadership opportunities that exist for women and promote gender equality in the workforce, it is essential for organizations to provide leadership development programs specifically targeted towards women.&amp;nbsp; The purposes of this research were to: (a) examine the ways participants were able to apply their knowledge and skills after participating in a leadership training program and, (b) explore the non-organizational experiences and benefits participants realized after participating in a leadership development program.&amp;nbsp; All participants in this study were females.&amp;nbsp; Key findings from this study indicated that as a result of participating in the Leadership Academy leadership training program, most participants expressed high levels of self-confidence regarding leadership positions as well as knowing their individual strengths.&amp;nbsp; Results of the qualitative findings suggested four emerging and descriptive themes that demonstrate perceived benefits: confidence builder, network facilitator, opportunity booster, and paying it forward. This study adds to existing literature suggesting that formal women-focused leadership training programs can facilitate gender equality in the workforce.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</dc:description>
