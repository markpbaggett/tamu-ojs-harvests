	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Calls for new ways to teach science include an emphasis on the human endeavor of science and for making science more relevant to a feminine perspective. This quasi-experimental intervention study of 166 middle school students approaches the teaching of the nature of science in an explicit and reflective way that also enhances the humanistic perspective of scientific knowledge construction. Girls in the experimental group significantly outperformed both boys in the experimental group and boys and girls in the comparison group on nature of science knowledge and on content knowledge. Differences were also found in the qualitative results. Girls saw the process of cognition as a group endeavor, whereas boys reported the process as being generated by themselves, with guidance from books or from the teacher. Additionally, girls in the experimental group tended to rely more on evidence in making conclusions and boys relied more on authority when they developed the "big ideas" in their inquiry.</dc:description>
