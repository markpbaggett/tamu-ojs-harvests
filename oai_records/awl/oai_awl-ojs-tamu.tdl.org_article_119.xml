	<dc:title xml:lang="en">Perceptions of School Leaders: Exploring School Climate Data Based on Principal Gender and Student Achievement</dc:title>
	<dc:creator xml:lang="en">Nichols, Joe</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This project explored the climate data of 33 elementary schools in an urban school system to determine the relationship among perceptions of effective school leadership and student achievement. Data was compiled from teachers (n = 847) at each elementary school in regard to their perceptions of effective leadership of their school principal. Data was compared to student achievement and disaggregated based upon the gender of the principal. In summary, female principals were rated significantly lower on their leadership skills than male principals by their staff. In contrast, when student standardized test data were explored and cross-referenced with the gender of the principal, student achievement at schools with female leadership was comparable with that of elementary sites with male leadership.</dc:description>
