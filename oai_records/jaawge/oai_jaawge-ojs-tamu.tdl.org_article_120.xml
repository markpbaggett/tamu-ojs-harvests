	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Black girls and women are regarded as one of the most vulnerable populations of students in academic settings. The research that highlights their academic experiences is generally deficit-based and does not emphasize models of success. The recognition of their educational accomplishments is often lacking in the body of knowledge and scholarly literature. Instead, a continued focus on their stigmatized group connection and at-risk status are present in research discourse. This retrospective grounded theory study aimed to move the current discourse to a strengths-based perspective focused on academic success. Intensive interviews were conducted to examine the academic experiences of twelve Black women. The emerged theoretical model posits that persistence leads to academic success and is facilitated by parental, psychosocial, and interpersonal factors. The model may guide those interested in supporting the academic retention and success of Black girls and women.</dc:description>
