	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Recent indicators continue to highlight the underrepresentation of Black girls and women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), from advanced course enrollment and degree attainment to employment. In this paper, we consider the role of stereotypes as an underlying motivational mechanism that shapes Black girls’ STEM identity and persistence. This theoretical review seeks to provide a conceptual foundation for research on gendered racial stereotype endorsement among Black girls and the differential ways girls may incorporate this knowledge as they navigate STEM learning environments. We define gendered racial stereotypes as widely held beliefs and depictions of Black girls (as a collective group) and their lived experience as perceived by broader society. Despite their awareness of stereotypes, Black girls frequently develop strategies to aid in their persistence. Although they may occasionally endorse these stereotypes, Black girls also use their understanding of stereotypes as a motivator to actively resist and disrupt deficit narratives. By utilizing process-oriented and culturally-informed approaches, we extend the current understanding of Black girls’ stereotype development. Additionally, we provide practical recommendations for research, policy, and educational praxis to aid in the continued positive development of Black girls’ identity in STEM learning environments.
