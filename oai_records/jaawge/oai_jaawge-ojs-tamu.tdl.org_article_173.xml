	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Black women in academia have long experienced racism and sexism in higher education systems. The COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of anti-Black racism since 2020 have exacerbated these challenges, leading to increased burnout among Black women faculty. This study aimed to investigate the experiences, wellbeing, and needs of Black women faculty during and since the dual pandemics of COVID-19 and anti-Black racism. The study used interview data to investigate variables such as conflict, health, reappointment promotion and tenure, support, silencing, belonging, rest, housekeeping tasks of academia, and interactions with students and colleagues. The findings of the study suggest that Black women in academia are experiencing high levels of stress, burnout, and mental health issues due to the intersecting challenges of racism, sexism, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The study recommends the implementation of support systems and resources to help Black women in academia cope with and thrive in their academic environments.</dc:description>
