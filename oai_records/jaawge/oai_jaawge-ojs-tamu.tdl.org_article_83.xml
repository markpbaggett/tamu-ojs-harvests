	<dc:description xml:lang="en">We are in a time and place where the lives of Black women and girls have to do more than "matter" in education; they must be researched, understood, and enhanced through transformative educational praxis. The Journal of African American Women and Girls in Education (JAAWGE) issued a call for papers for its inaugural issue that sought to elucidate Black women and girls' educational experiences across a variety of disciplines, contexts, and geographic settings. Through this work, the constituency of JAAWGE aims to illuminate Black women and girls' brilliance and resilience by placing their voices at the forefront of educational research and discourse, while leading and creating pathways that are not only attainable, but sustainable. This inaugural issue highlights research from various fields that speak directly to the multiplicity of these women and girlsâ€™ experiences in education across disciplines that utilize a vast array of theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches that are humanizing and centered on Black women and girls.</dc:description>
