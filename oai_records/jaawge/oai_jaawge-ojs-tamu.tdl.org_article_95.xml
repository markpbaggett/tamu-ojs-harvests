	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Research to explore the experiences of Black women graduate students in colleges and universities is limited despite the increased focus and prioritization of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, particularly at Predominantly White Institutions. This is problematic as Black women have the highest increases of graduate school attainment rates in the United States of all gender and racial/gender groups; yet, these settings are not equipped to support them. Grounded in Intersectionality and Womanist perspectives, this study explores the educational experiences of 19 Black women who recently obtained graduate degrees from Predominantly White Institutions. Findings from the study reveal that in these environments, no spaces were created to nurture them in their interlocking identities, students engaged in distancing dilemmas, diversity efforts appeared delusional, collective efforts by the students generated achievement, and positive mentoring lessened inequality gaps. Concrete and practical strategies are provided to systematically support Black women graduate students and relieve them of the burden of self-reliance.</dc:description>
