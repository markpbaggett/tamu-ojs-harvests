	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Critical thinking skills are invaluable for the process of asking reasonable questions and making rational decisions. Science classrooms are an excellent place to develop critical thinking skills for all students. Unfortunately, Black girls are often left out from opportunities to be in good science classrooms and/or exposed to effective science instruction. This marginalization diminishes their access to critical thinking skill development. Because Black girls, for a variety of reasons are not participating in science education they are missing the opportunity to develop, exercise and enhance their critical thinking skills. One approach that has shown promising effectiveness in developing critical thinking skills is the Science Writing Heuristic (SWH). The SWH approach helps students develop skills in the process of asking questions, making claims, and providing evidence through argument-based inquiry. The current study examines the impact of the SWH on critical thinking skills growth of 5th grade Black girls in a midwestern state. Results suggest practical implications for using the SWH to develop critical thinking skills for Black girls over the course of a school year. Statistical significance was found within the treatment group in two to subtest of the critical thinking measure when comparing pre- and post-test results. Practical analysis via effect size statistics is also discussed.</dc:description>
