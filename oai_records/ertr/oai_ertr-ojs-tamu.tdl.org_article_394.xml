	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study was conducted to investigate attractions of geotourism and industrial tourism in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone, Bushehr province, Iran. Also, tourism priorities were identified as well as providing appropriate strategies for tourism development. Then, tourism capacity was studied in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) using the SWOT method. Data were collected using questionnaire surveys and unstructured interviews, field surveys, and documentary information, and then strengths, weaknesses, threats, and effective opportunities were analyzed by SWOT. Finally, appropriate strategies were provided for tourism development. Results showed that defensive strategy is the most suitable strategy in tourism development of the PSEEZ. Aims of this strategy are 1) improvement of tourism management; 2) development of transportation and infrastructures; 3) financial support; 4) modification of restricting laws for visiting industrial sites; 5) prevention of degradation and pollution of natural and cultural heritage, and 6) development of tourism information system.</dc:description>
