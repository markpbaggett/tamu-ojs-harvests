	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The purpose of this study is to identify common components in mission statements of hotel chains, as missions play important role in strategic management of all kinds of organizations and influence on their performance. The research is based on recognition of "standard" content components, namely customers, markets, image, products and/or services, technology, survival, growth, and profitability, philosophy, self-understanding, and employees in the mission statements of seventeen hotel chains (international and national). The main findings are as follows. The majority of the statements bear 2-4 components, among which the most frequent and best explained is philosophy. In contrast, the hotel chains pay the least attention to image, technologies, and employees. Environmental focus is totally absent. The originality of this empirical research is linked to filling an important gap in the existing literature: unlike to many other organizations, mission statements of hotel chains have been addressed weakly. This study permits giving some practical recommendations on mission statements improvement. The main limitation is linked to consideration of only 17 statements due to poor representation of these strategic communications on official web-pages of hotel chains. Future research should take into account a bigger number of mission statements, as well as to focus on different categories of collective accommodation facilities, restaurants, and other related hospitality firms.</dc:description>
