	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The idea for the development of this paper came from the chance of a lecture that was requested to be given and which referred to the topic of drawing, charting, and mapping a cultural route. Looking for additional published material at the international level, it was observed that at the technical level (that is, the drawing of a cultural route from a technical point of view); there was a huge gap, with almost non-existent literature. At the same time, it was observed that many students were not ready to identify and choose an appropriate method to use when the time came to draw up a cultural thematic route. The main objective of this paper is to fill this educational gap by proposing a methodological approach that could be followed, from a technical point of view, to draw a cultural route through topography and spatial analysis.</dc:description>
