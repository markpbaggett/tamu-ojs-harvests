	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The worldwide expansion of the COVID-19 virus has provoked a worldwide emergency, especially in the travel and hospitality industries. The aftermath of this crisis is potentially more significant than those caused by previous events such as 9/11, SARS, and the Great Recession of 2008. The pandemic has disrupted the supply chain within the tourism industry, affecting stakeholders in tourism destinations worldwide. Malaysia has been particularly impacted, with tourist arrivals dropping below what was recorded in 2000, almost two decades ago. This study examines the issues and obstacles faced by Malaysian stakeholders in the tourism industry due to the widespread occurrence of the COVID-19 virus and discusses its theoretical background and impacts. The paper concludes with managerial recommendations to overcome both short- and long-term challenges while minimizing the impact on the global economy.</dc:description>
