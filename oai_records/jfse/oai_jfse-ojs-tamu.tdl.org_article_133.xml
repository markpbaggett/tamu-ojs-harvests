	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Forensic Science Education Programs Accreditation Commission (FEPAC) is an organization that seeks to highlight and enhance the quality of forensic science education at colleges and universities; many graduates of FEPAC-accredited programs are hired by crime laboratory forensic science service providers (FSSPs). Standards collaboratively written by academics and professionals in the forensic science field and published by standards development organizations (SDOs) seek to enhance the quality of the work product by FSSPs. Many of these standards are listed on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Organization of Scientific Area Committees (OSAC) Forensic Science Registry. The OSAC Registry is a repository of selected proposed and published standards which the forensic science community is encouraged to implement to advance and standardize the forensic science practice. The Academy Standards Boardâ€™s (ASB) DNA training standards have standardized concepts and topics, but not the actual curriculum. Following discussions with NIST staff and laboratory directors about this gap, funding was received from the NIST Measurement Science and Engineering Grant Program to develop a curriculum for one standard: ANSI/ASB Standard 115, Standard for Training in Forensic Short Tandem Repeat Typing Methods using Amplification, DNA Separation, and Allele Detection. Herein the process and goals and a collaborative model of the approach are described including assembling and working with an external advisory board, surveying and interviewing laboratory directors and their designees on their forensic DNA training programs, development of a standardized forensic DNA curriculum and assessment tool, and dissemination of the deliverables. The collaborative model could be replicated and implemented in other disciplines including forensic toxicology, forensic anthropology, and pattern analysis.</dc:description>
