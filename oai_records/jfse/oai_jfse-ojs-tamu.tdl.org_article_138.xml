	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Self-confidence has been positively associated with various facets of accomplishment in academics, such as academic performance, persistence, and future employability of graduated students. In this mixed-methods study, forensic science students' self-confidence and future confidence levels at different points in their undergraduate degrees are measured and compared. Independent T-tests are utilized to compare the self-confidence and future confidence levels of forensic science students at the beginning of their forensic science degrees and forensic science students in the last year of their forensic science degrees. Additionally, open-response questions were analyzed using thematic analysis to gain further insight into the current confidence levels of forensic science students and where these students derive their confidence in themselves and their confidence in their futures as professional forensic scientists. The results show that forensic science students in the final year of their degree are reporting lower self-confidence levels and lower confidence in their futures as forensic science professionals. Further insight into studentsâ€™ perceptions of their confidence levels reveals that students in the first and final years of their forensic science degrees derive their confidence in contrasting ways that may be linked to their views regarding their future employability in the field. This paper highlights how the next class of future forensic science professionals are concerned about their employability and ability to support themselves, and the potential link to lower confidence levels in both themselves and their futures as forensic science professionals.</dc:description>
