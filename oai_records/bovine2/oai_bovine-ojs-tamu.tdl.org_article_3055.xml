	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A retrospective investigation (RI) of Acute Bovine Pulmonary Emphysema (ABPE) involved 14 veterinarians, 20 premises, and 30 occurrences of the disease in 10 Northern California counties. There were 9,851 cattle at risk in the investigation, and 6,046 of these were adults. The adult mortality rate was 2.61 %. Attack rates and case fatality rates were variable; but in general, inversely related. Calves were not significantly affected. Cases were noted in all months except February and December.
A statistically designed random sample survey (RS) was conducted on 81 premises in three of the counties. Equivalent mortality rates were found in the RI and the RS for each class of cattle. Sex differences were not statistically significant. Type of forage management was found to be significant (p &amp;lt; .005) to the occurrence of ABPE. The incidence of ABPE was estimated at 594 adult cases with 121 deaths out of 90,688 cattle in Lassen, Modoc, and Siskiyou counties. The total estimated economic costs for ABPE in these three counties was $127,550.00 in 1973.</dc:description>
