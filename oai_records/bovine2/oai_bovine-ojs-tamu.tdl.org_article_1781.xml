	<dc:description xml:lang="en">characteristics of farms (herd size, objectives to join, etc.) which participated in the core and Johne’s disease (JD) modules of the New York State Cattle Health Assurance Program (NYSCHAP). In addition, we evaluated whether the NYSCHAP JD module was successful in motivating farmers to adopt recommended management practices that limit transmission of enteric diseases, including JD. First, descriptive parameters of farms engaged in the NYSCHAP were determined. Second, adoption of recommended management practices was evaluated in a sub-group of farms.The average NYSCHAP herd was larger than the average dairy herd in New York state and had higher milk production. Goals for participation in the JD module mentioned most frequently by participants were 1) limit transmission of the disease, 2) become a JD negative herd and 3) gain information and have knowledge to change management on the farm. Most farms (94%) intended to do some kind of herd testing for JD and 83% intended to test 75-100% of their herd. The large number of laboratory tests conducted for each farm showed that completed testing corresponded with intended plans. The average percentage of advised management practices implemented by a sub-group of NYSCHAP herds was 74%. This indicates that the average farm appeared to implement 13 of 17 advised measures. An educational, process-oriented program, such as NYSCHAP, may be a successful way to encourage producers to improve herd health management on farms.</dc:description>
