	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Feedlot operators commonly face the highest morbidity and mortality in calves within the first few weeks of their arrival at their feedlots. The objectives of this investigation were to determine whether or not a single injection of sustained action oxytetracycline (oxytet LA) given to all calves at processing is economically beneficial, and second, whether or not this regimen would change the disease and/or death patterns in these animals. 1083 calves between 500 and 800 pounds arriving at a southern Alberta feedlot during November, 1985, were used in this trial. One half of the calves in each truckload (processing group) were given a single prophylactic intramuscular injection of 6 gms of oxytet LA; the other half were not medicated at this time and thus served as control animals.
Treatment rate for the medicated group was 58.7% versus 66.2% for the control group. A mortality of 2.2% was observed in the medicated group, and a significantly higher mortality of 6.0% in the control group. Morbidity occurred earlier and more frequently in the control group. There was a large reduction in average total health cost per head in the medicated group; the net benefit was $16.30 (Can.) per head.</dc:description>
