	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Until the middle of this century the diagnosis “hypotony” or “atony” of the rumen was one of the most frequent diagnoses in veterinary practice. Rumen atony was considered as a primary disease and its removal was considered as the definitive therapeutic task. Subsequently it has been demonstrated that a great number of digestive disorders as well as other organic or general diseases can inhibit reticulo-ruminal motility. On the basis of our present knowledge the following disorders of the rumen and reticulum can be coordinated to the definition (term) Indigestion. At first primary and secondary indigestions have to be distinguished. The primary indigestions can be subgrouped into motor dysfunctions and disorders of the microbial-biochemical digestion. The primary disorders of the motor functions of the rumen and reticulum can be differentiated presently. Today the question arises whether a primary, a genuine ruminal stasis, really exists or at least whether conditions exist in which the inhibition of the motility of the forestomachs can be considered as the definitive finding.</dc:description>
