	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The effect of oxytetracycline intra-uterine infusion on reproductive performance of 20 Holstein and Ayrshire cows with retained fetal membranes (RFM), or with post-partum metritis (47 cows) was studied in comparison to 37 normal post-partum cows. Cows with post-partum metritis were those found to have an abnormal cervical and uterine involution and/or abnormal vaginal discharge, based on weekly palpation and daily appraisal. Cows with RFM were those that had no expelled the membranes by 12 hours and were treated sooner than cows with evident metritis. Also, more treatments were given to the RFM cows. In addition RFM cows completed treatment sooner after calving than non-RFM cows. Palpable cervical and uterine involution (diameter) during the first 40 days was not different among normal cows, cows with RFM and post-partum metritic cows. Reproductive performance as characterized by interval to first estrus, services per conception, post-partum interval to conception and percentage cows conceiving were comparable between normal cows and those treated for metritis with or without RFM.</dc:description>
