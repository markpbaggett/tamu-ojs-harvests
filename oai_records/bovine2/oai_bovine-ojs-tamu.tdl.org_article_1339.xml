	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Prevention of ruminant digital disease is the modern approach to this increasingly recognized economically significant problem. Successful cattle breeders and feeders are no longer satisfied with successful treatment of a lame animal. They demand to know why the animal became lame and how to prevent further lamenesses in their herds. They are aware that when an animal becomes lame a financial loss has already occurred and treatment only limits the amount of loss. Only a small profit is realized per healthy animal under ideal conditions and a herd lameness problem very quickly leads to economic disaster. When treating a lame animal it is, of course, essential that treatment be successful but the prophylactic advice offered is often of far greater economic benefit to the cattle owner. In order to give sound advice we must be knowledgeable not only in cattle diseases but also many facets of cattle husbandry; such as breeding, feeding, housing, and hoof trimming.</dc:description>
