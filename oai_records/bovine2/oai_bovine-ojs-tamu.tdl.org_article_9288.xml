	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) in feedyard cattle is a re­spiratory condition characterized by sudden onset of respira­tory distress and, often, rapid mortality. The exact etiology of AIP remains unclear and multiple risk factors are hypoth­esized to contribute to AIP development. The objective of this retrospective study was to determine the probability of at least one AIP mortality occurring in a cohort (AIPMort) and potential associations with cohort arrival characteristics and disease incidence in the first 45 days-on-feed. Variables analyzed included sex, head received, arrival weight, arrival month, bovine respiratory disease (BRD) morbidity and mor­tality, and digestive disease morbidity and mortality. Cohort and corresponding individual animal treatment records were acquired from 20 feedyards in the United States, resulting in 27,324 cohorts over 4 years. At least 1 AIP mortality was pres­ent in 5,525 (20.2%) cohorts. All risk factors were significantly associated with AIPMort. Heifer cohorts were more likely (19.5% ± 0.048) to experience AIPMort than steer cohorts (13.3% ± 0.035). Cohorts with greater than 5% BRD morbidity in the first 45 days-on-feed were more likely to experience an AIPMort (20.2% ± 0.049) than cohorts that had 0% morbidity (8% ± 0.025). Improved understanding of risk factors associ­ated with AIPMort can be valuable for managing cohorts.</dc:description>
