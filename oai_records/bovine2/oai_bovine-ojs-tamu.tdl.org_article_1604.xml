	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A retrospective epidemiological study was undertaken of 78,445 male cattle that entered a 24,000- head feedlot in western Canada from 1991 to 1993 to determine if an association existed between sickness, mortality, and bullers. Animal health records for bullers were collected and analysed to see if they were at greater risk of sickness and mortality than other steers, and to see if pens with a high prevalence of bullers also had a high prevalence of sickness and mortality. The prevalence of bullers increased with increasing age of cattle on arrival at the feedlot (R = 0.36; P &amp;lt; 0.001). Sickness and mortality decreased with increasing age of cattle on arrival. However, sickness and mortality in bullers relative to other steers actually increased with increasing age on arrival suggesting an interaction existed between sickness and bullers. Bullers were significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.05) more likely to get sick and to die than other steers. In all cases, there was a strong temporal association between sickness and bullers, with sickness and bullers mostly occurring within the first 30 days of the feeding period. On average, pens of cattle with a high prevalence of bullers did not have a correspondingly high prevalence of sickness or mortality. Sickness would appear to be an effect modifier of dominance behaviour and therefore bullers in feedlot steers. Bullers should always be checked for signs of sickness and treated accordingly. Further research is needed to investigate the effects of sickness on dominance behaviour in pens of feedlot cattle.</dc:description>
