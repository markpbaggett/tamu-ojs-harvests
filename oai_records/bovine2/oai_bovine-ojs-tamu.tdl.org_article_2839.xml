	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this research was to evaluate the usefulness of a novel calf VIGOR assessment tool to measure birth trauma and associations with future health and growth. In addition, pain management therapy using meloxicam injectable solution was evaluated for calves suffering from birth trauma and reduced vigor. A total of 842 heifer and bull calves from 10 commercial dairy herds were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind clinical field trial. At birth, newborn VIGOR was evaluated by the dairy producer to assess the Visual appearance, Initiation of movement, General responsiveness, Oxygenation, as well as heart and respiration Rate of the calf. Subsequently, calves were administered either a 1.0 mL subcutaneous injection of meloxicam or placebo solution. Each calf was measured for growth and assessed using a standardized clinical score for health at 1, 2, 3, and 6 weeks of age. Compared to unassisted calvings, calves born with assistance had lower vigor. Assisted calves treated with meloxicam had improved weight gain in the first week compared to placebo-treated calves. In contrast, treatment with meloxicam resulted in lower gains in observed but unassisted calves. Calves with improved newborn vigor and better health had significantly greater weight gain up to 6 weeks of age. Meloxicam-treated calves had better health from birth to 6 weeks of age. Overall, the calf VIGOR score is a good indicator of trauma at calving. Meloxicam therapy shows promise for improving health and growth, particularly for calves born with assistance.</dc:description>
