	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dairy herd mortality rates have increased over the last 3 decades but dairy producers appear to be underutilizing veterinarians to perform postmortem examinations. The purpose of this project was to identify dairy veterinarian motivations and barriers for performing necropsies and use of diagnostic laboratories. A 33-question online survey was developed and a link sent to members of a dairy veterinary continuing education group in the western United States. Fifty-two veterinarians responded and many (70%) were offering 12 or more services to their dairy clients, including necropsy. Although 88% of dairy veterinarians surveyed considered necropsy to be a very to extremely useful tool, only 19% said all dairies within their practice utilized necropsy services. The producer's refusal of the service was the primary reason that discouraged practitioners from performing a necropsy (69%), followed by time (44%), cost (38%), and carcass disposal (27%). Factors most commonly reported to promote a necropsy were 'multiple animals affected' (85%) and 'unexplained death' (75%). Because identification of a cause of death could inform herd health management, these results indicate an opportunity to educate dairy producers on the value of necropsy services.</dc:description>
