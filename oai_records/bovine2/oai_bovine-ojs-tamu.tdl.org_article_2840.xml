	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this study was to assess the preweaning performance, health, and survival of calves fed fresh colostrum from their dams compared to calves receiving colostrum that was not from their dams, and had been stored frozen or refrigerated. A total of 182 Holstein heifer calves born during July and August 2010 at a north-central Florida dairy farm were included. Explanatory variables included colostrum source, adjusted colostrum score, total estimated IgG intake, time to colostrum feeding, and calf-serum total protein determination as a measure of colostral immunoglobulin absorption. Control variables comprised birth weight and dam parity number. Average daily weight gain (ADG) was not affected by colostrum source. Number of disease events was the only variable showing a significant negative association with ADG (P=0.001), but there was a tendency to significance for lower-birth weight to be associated with a higher number of disease events; P=0.08. Source of colostrum did not affect the number of disease events or the total number of days on treatment. Similarly, no significant association with calf mortality was found for colostrum source. Time to event analyses did not indicate any significant association between morbidity and mortality and any of the explanatory variables, including colostrum source. We concluded that colostrum source was not significantly associated with performance, health, and survival in this population of dairy calves.</dc:description>
