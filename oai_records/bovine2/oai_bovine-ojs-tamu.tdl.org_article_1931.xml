	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Observations on the relationship between the eruption of the maxillary first molar (fourth cheek) tooth and age have been made in groups of Hereford x Friesian steers. This work resulted in the definitions of varying stages of tooth eruption for the first molar tooth; the terms rostral and caudal are used in accordance with current anatomical terminology. The first molar tooth consists of four cusps which are grouped in pairs as rostral and caudal units or parts of the tooth. The cusps in each unit are separated by an infundibulum. It will be noted that the rostral part of the tooth was always in advance of the caudal part. The maxillary tooth was examined in preference to the mandibular counterpart because it was easier to observe in the live animal as it was not obscured by the tongue. The previous work had indicated that estimation of age by eruption of the cheek teeth in cattle might be of use. This study involved young bulls of three red-coated beef breeds being reared at a bull performance testing centre.</dc:description>
