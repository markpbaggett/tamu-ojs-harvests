	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A yearling black-baldy steer was presented to the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital on August 4, 1986. The owner reported that the steer had been depressed, losing weight, anorexic and not drinking. This steer was one of 220 calves purchased by the owner to be used as Stockers. Of the 220 calves there were four currently sick and five dead. The steer presented was representative of the herd problem.
These calves had been on the present location for thirty days and the first calf noticed sick was fourteen days ago. The calves were on a pasture containing mixed bermuda and native grass. Eleven acres of the pasture contained alfalfa with Kochia mixed in. There was also a pasture of millet which the owner reported the calves would not eat.
Upon arrival the steer had a temperature of 103.9Â° F, heart rate 72 and regular and respiratory rate was 24. The steer was thin, weak and had a rough hair coat. The head was swollen and there was excess lacrimal and nasal discharge. The mucous membranes were pale and yellow and mucosal and nasal ulcers were present. The underside of the tongue was ulcerated and necrotic.</dc:description>
