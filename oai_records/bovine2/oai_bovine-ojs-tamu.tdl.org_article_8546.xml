Pre-weaned beef and dairy calves that fail to receive mater­nal antibodies are more susceptible to disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the as­sociation between failed transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) and disease in pre-weaned beef and dairy calves. Three data­bases were searched for relevant studies that evaluated calves diagnosed with FTPI at ≤8 days of age and recorded incidence of disease pre-weaning. Twenty-three, out of 182 identified ref­erences, were relevant and contained 46 studies. Twelve stud­ies evaluated the effect of FTPI on morbidity, 18 on mortality, 8 on diarrhea, and 8 on pneumonia. Forty-two of 46 studies (91.3%) reported greater risk for disease among FTPI calves. The strength of association between FTPI and disease var­ied and was not resolved by subgrouping by outcome, animal type, test, cut-off point, or cumulative incidence of disease. Failed transfer of passive immunity is a component cause of calf disease that may have a greater impact in some popula­tions than others.</dc:description>
