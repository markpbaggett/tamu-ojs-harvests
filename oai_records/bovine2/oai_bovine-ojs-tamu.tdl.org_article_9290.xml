	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Reproductive management options for non-domesticated ru­minants are limited. This manuscript describes a case report where a semi-tame, 19-month-old bison underwent field an­esthesia for a laparoscopic ovariectomy, a procedure that has not been described previously in this species. Initially the bi­son was restrained in a hydraulic chute and sedated with BAM (butorphanol-azaperone-medetomidine), but it became evi­dent during clipping and early manipulation that due to chute design and the animal’s movement, standing surgery would not be feasible. After dialogue among the team and owner, a decision was made to anesthetize her and attempt the pro­cedure. Due to the need for carbon dioxide insufflation, the bison was intubated and intermittently ventilated. A standard bilateral flank approach was utilized following aseptic prepa­ration and local anesthetic at portal sites. Each ovary was identified and removed. The mesosalpinx was blocked with 2% mepivacaine and amputated. The skin was closed with 0 synthetic monofilament absorbable suture (Maxon) and the animal recovered in sternal recumbency. Atipamezole and naltrexone were administered intramuscularly and the bison observed until standing and loaded onto a trailer.</dc:description>
