	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of viral vaccines and vaccination programs on health and performance of newly received beef cattle. In Exp. 1, two loads (120 steer and bull calves and 108 heifer calves for Load 1 and 2, respectively) were used to evaluate the effects of an intranasal vs an intramuscular IBR-PI3 vaccine on performance and health of newly received beef cattle. Treatments were: 1) no vaccine (Control); 2) an intranasal modified-live IBR-PI3 vaccine (IN); and 3) an intramuscular modified-live IBR-PI3 vaccine (IM). No treatment x load interactions were observed for performance data. For the 28-d receiving period, cattle given IN IBR-PI3 vaccine had greater daily gain (P &amp;lt; .05) than cattle given IM IBR-PI3 vaccine. No differences (P &amp;gt; .10) were noted for daily dry matter (DM) intake, however, the feed:gain ratio was increased (P &amp;lt; .05) for the IM group as compared to the IN group. No differences (P &amp;gt; .10) were noted among treatments in the percentage of cattle treated for BRD. In Exp. 2, 102 steer and bull calves were used to evaluate vaccine timing on health and performance of newly received calves. Treatments included: 1) no vaccine (Control); 2) no vaccine at processing, with an IM multiple antigen (IBR-PI3-BVD-BRSV) viral vaccine given on d 7; 3) intranasal IBR-PI3 administered at processing with IM IBR-PI3-BVD-BRSV vaccine given on d 7; and 4) IM IBR-PI3-BVD-BRSV vaccine administered both at processing and on d 7. No differences were noted for daily gain or daily DM intake during the 28-d receiving period. Feed:gain was improved (P &amp;lt; .10) for vaccinated calves as compared to controls. Results suggest that an intranasal IBR-PI3 vaccine might have beneficial effects on gain and feed efficiency compared with an intramuscular IBR-PI:-i vaccine. There was no advantage or disadvantage to delaying vaccination with viral vaccines until 7 d after arrival. In terms of overall 28-d gains and morbidity, vaccines did not enhance gains or effect morbidity, compared to negative controls. However, statistical power to detect differences was marginal in both experiments.</dc:description>
