	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Maintaining adequate intake and performance during hot weather can be a constant challenge in some areas. Problems are more likely to be incurred with confinement than with pasture cattle because higher levels of performance (i.e. daily gain) are expected and because of other constraints. Therefore, most of the discussion herein will be directed toward feedlot or confinement cattle although some pertinent items would also apply to cattle in pasture environments.
Problems with reduced performance become especially critical when cattle are heat stressed. Health disorders with bloat and acidosis in feedlot cattle can increase as well during hot weather because of drastic changes in eating pattern. In some locations, such as the High Plains, even though temperatures may be rather high during certain months, cattle may still do quite well especially where the humidity is low, and there is considerable wind. Higher elevations usually facilitate a better environment. However, not all cattle feeding areas in the U.S. or in the world are blessed with good conditions during hot months. Even locations with a generally favorable environment may at times incur miserable conditions, compromising performance.</dc:description>
