	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Dairy production systems in the United States have changed considerably over the last several decades due to forces that promote economic efficiency of production and to scientific and technological advances that afford opportunities for change. Societal values and concerns about animal wellbeing, and specifically about livestock production systems and their impact on animal wellbeing, have also changed throughout this time. It would be worthwhile for dairy producers and veterinarians to critically evaluate production practices for their impact on the animals. Optimizing animal wellbeing is not only a moral imperative, but should also assure optimal animal productivity. This manuscript attempts to summarize industry changes that impact dairy animal management, and to highlight areas of real or perceived concern about dairy animal welfare that warrant careful attention by producers and veterinarians. For readers who want to review more comprehensive literature on animal welfare in other livestock production industries, this material was originally published as a chapter in the book The Wellbeing of Farm Animals: Challenges and Solutions, GJ Benson and BE Rollin (eds), Iowa State University Press, 2004.</dc:description>
