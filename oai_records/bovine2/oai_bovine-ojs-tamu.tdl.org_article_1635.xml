	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Many management practices can be utilized to maximize weight and increase value of calves at weaning. Combining the two management practices of castration and implanting male calves allows producers to maximize weaning weights and avoid discounts for intact males. Crossbred bull calves were randomly assigned at birth to 1 of 3 treatment groups: castrated (n = 22), banded (n = 18) or left intact (n = 20). Calves that were castrated or banded within 24 h after birth received a zeranol implant at that time. Calves in the intact group were castrated at 150 days of age and then implanted, and the calves in the other 2 treatment groups were re-implanted at that time. There were no differences in weaning weight, average daily gain (ADG) or weight per day of age between the 3 treatment groups. Castrating calves shortly after birth reduced stress on the animal compared to castration at a older age (day 150 to weaning). Also, early castration may be more acceptable as an animal welfare issue. It is concluded that combining castration and implanting allows producers to maximize weaning weight of calves as well as reduce the stress of castration at an older age.</dc:description>
