	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Two randomized studies of Angus beef calves (n = 110) from 2 Iowa locations were used to determine the effect of vaccine type and route of administration on weight gain and inflammatory response. The first vaccine contained avirulent-live Mannheimia haemolytica (type A1) and Pasteu- rella multocida (type A3), and was administered intranasally (IN group). The second vaccine contained an adjuvanted M. haemolytica (type Al) toxoid and was administered subcutaneously (SC group). Control calves (CON) were given the same volume (2 mL) of sterile saline SC as other calves. At the time of vaccination (day 0), calf body weight (BW) and body temperature (BT) were recorded, and a blood sample was collected for serum haptoglobin analysis. Blood collection and BT measurement were repeated on days 1, 2, and 3 while BW was recorded on days 3 and 21 (location 1) or 24 (location 2) after vaccination. A final BW was taken at weaning at both locations. Changes in BW among calves during the first 3 days after vaccination were not significantly different across treatment groups. At location 1, calves given SC vaccine had a higher average BT compared to IN-vaccinated calves (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Body temperature also tended to be higher in SC-vaccinated calves (P = 0.08) compared to CON calves. At location 2, BT was not different between vaccinated groups, but vaccinated calves had higher BT compared to CON calves (P&amp;lt; 0.01). Over the 21-day trial period at location 1, average daily gain (ADG) in calves given SC vaccine was lower compared to CON calves (P = 0.04). At location 2, ADG was not significantly different among treatments, but IN calves had heavier final weights compared to other treatment groups (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Serum haptoglobin levels were higher for SC calves compared to IN and CON calves on days 1, 2, and 3 following vaccination (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Mean weight gain and ADG from vaccination through weaning tended to be greater (P = 0.06) for IN calves at location 1, but were not different at location 2.</dc:description>
