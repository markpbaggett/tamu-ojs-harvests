	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The use of slatted concrete floors (SCF) in indoor confinement housing facilities for finishing beef cattle has increased among US cattle feeders, particularly in the Midwest. The objective of this study was to investigate potential health and performance differences associated with slatted concrete flooring not covered with rubber mats (SCF) and slatted concrete flooring covered with rubber mats (RM) in confined beef operations during the finishing phase of production. An observational cohort study design was conducted by enrolling 4258 calves among 35 pens to compare selected health and performance parameters between beef calves fed in indoor confinement housing using either SCF or RM management. Compared to cattle in the RM group, SCF cattle tended to have higher morbidity (20.5% vs 7.6%; P=0.0701). Cattle in the SCF group had an increased frequency of lameness diagnosis (3.1% vs 1.2%; P=0.0358), increased locomotion score at the end of the feeding period (P=0.0050), and higher mortality (2.1% vs 0.7%; OR=2.1346, P=0.0448). There was no difference between RM and SCF in average daily gain (P=0.2174), mean feed intake (P=0.1986) or mean feed:gain ratio (P=0.6139) when compared to cattle fed indoors on concrete slats without rubber mats. This study demonstrated potential increased health and welfare benefits, but not performance benefits, when rubber mats were utilized.</dc:description>
