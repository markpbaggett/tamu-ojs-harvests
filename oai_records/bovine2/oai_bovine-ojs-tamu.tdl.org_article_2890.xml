	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Beef producers and veterinarians work together to improve cattle health and well-being. Antibiotic use and resistance is of interest to all involved in the beef industry, including beef consumers. A 26-question survey was developed by veterinarians at Kansas State University to explore antibiotic use and opinions on contemporary issues at the beef producer level. The survey was advertised throughout the United States and Canada via popular industry outlets. A total of 260 surveys were completed by beef producers from 43 states and 1 province in Canada. Beef producers operating cow-calf operations represented 88% of the respondents. Producers managing stocker, backgrounder, and feeder operations were represented in equal proportions in the remaining survey responses. Eighty-five percent (85%) of beef producers indicated they use the services of a veterinarian regularly, while only 23% reported that they have a written, documented, and signed veterinary-client-patient relationship. Participants indicated that they rarely use oral and injectable antibiotics. The most common indication for antibiotic use in cattle managed by respondents was for the treatment of bovine respiratory disease, foot rot, and pinkeye. Seventy-two percent (72%) of producers indicated that Beef Quality Assurance is an important industry program for addressing antibiotic use and prevention of antibiotic residues. When asked if familiar with the Veterinary Feed Directive rule, 81% of respondents indicated they had knowledge of the law. These data illustrate that beef producers are willing to share information about their production systems and management strategies, including information on antibiotic use in cattle.</dc:description>
