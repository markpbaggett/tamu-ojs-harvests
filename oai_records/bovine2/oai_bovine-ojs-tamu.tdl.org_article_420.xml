	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A comprehensive, mutual veterinary service is practiced in Israel under the nationwide Mutual Society for Cattle Insurance and Veterinary Services "Hachaklait". The package offered under contract includes emergency treatment, preventive and herd medicine, consulting services and supportive laboratory services. The routine by which the balance between individual cow and herd medicine, and that between the clinical and the supportive services are achieved is described in detail. Early professional treatment of all clinical diseases, discovery of diseases by routine tests and examinations, a regular presence on the farm and the use of "real time" diagnostic laboratories are the essence of the individual cow therapy. The value of following feeding plans, vaccination programs, and other preventive measures in optimization disease prevalence is stressed. The statistical and clinical epidemiological approach to herd problems is described and some of the problems associated with integrated herd health programs are discussed.</dc:description>
