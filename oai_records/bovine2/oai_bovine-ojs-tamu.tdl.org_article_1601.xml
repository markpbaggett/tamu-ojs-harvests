	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Atresia coli is a congenital abnormality in cattle that is lethal without surgical correction. Although the condition has been reported predominantly in the Holstein-Friesian breed, the inheritance of atresia coli remains controversial and not completely understood. A systematic review of published cases and hospital-based case-control study were undertaken to evaluate breed as a risk factor for atresia coli in cattle, and to determine the best method for surgical management. Systematic review of 37 published studies indicated that atresia coli has been diagnosed in 10 cattle breeds and 12 countries, with the marked preponderance of cases occurring in Holstein-Friesian calves. Epidemiologic analysis indicated that Holstein-Friesian cattle were at significantly greater risk for the condition than all other dairy cattle breeds (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) and all other cattle breeds (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). Atresia coli probably occurs secondary to vascular insufficiency of the developing colon in calves. Holstein-Friesian cattle are predisposed to atresia coli, probably because their developing colon grows at a faster rate and/or to a greater extent than that in other cattle breeds. Early or vigorous palpation per rectum of the amniotic vesicle appears to increase the risk of atresia coli in a predisposed fetus, probably through palpation-induced damage to the rapidly developing colonic vasculature. Surgical correction of atresia coli had a poor overall success rate (short term survival rate was &amp;lt;50%) and long term survival rate (&amp;lt;35%). Because of the poor survival rate, expense, and potential for propagation of a genetic defect, definitive surgical correction should not be routinely performed on affected Holstein-Friesian calves.</dc:description>
