	<dc:description xml:lang="en">&amp;nbsp;The objective of this study was to validate the effectiveness of a penetrating captive bolt when positioned behind the poll as a single-step method for humane euthanasia of cattle. Seven­teen bovine animals of various ages (neonate to mature) that were eligible for euthanasia were enrolled in the study. Cattle were euthanized using a penetrating captive bolt gun with an extended bolt positioned flush against the parietal bone on midline just behind the poll and aimed toward the base of the tongue. Clinical and ECG parameters were monitored and recorded following application of the poll shot method. One animal required a second shot due to improper angle of the captive bolt device. All properly placed and aimed shots suc­cessfully induced immediate loss of consciousness without re­turn to sensibility which was followed by clinical death. Once unconscious, none of the cattle required a secondary step to assure clinical death. Following death, the head was removed, transected sagittally on midline, and brain trauma was as­sessed and scored. A properly placed and aimed poll shot was determined to be an effective single-step method of euthana­sia of cattle when using a penetrating captive bolt.</dc:description>
