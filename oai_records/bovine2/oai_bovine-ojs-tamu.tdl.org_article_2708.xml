	<dc:description xml:lang="en">More remarkable discoveries have been made in science during my adult lifetime than in all of recorded history. When the atom was split (at the time of World War II), those of us who were in our 20’s thought that it was excitement enough for one lifetime. But discovery after discovery has occurred, utilizing new instrumentation, radioactive-labeled substances and remarkable new techniques. Molecular biology was born and blossomed. And now we’re beginning to really appreciate the flowers that are blossoming all around us. Rivaling the splitting of the atom and its many beneficial consequences is what has come to be called genetic engineering and related technology. Terms like genesplitting and recombinant DNA are becoming almost household words. In our laboratories (and many others), we are utilizing many of the new techniques involving monoclonal antibodies and hybridomas which are somewhat less than household words. There is renewed excitement about the prospects of remarkable advances to be made in the future. By splicing genetic material and reshuffling hereditary material, we are at the threshhold of using bacteria to manufacture many life-saving substances for people and animals.</dc:description>
