	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A Delphi-like survey series was used to gain knowledge about feedyard biosecurity and security from feedyard managers and feedyard veterinarians. A panel of managers and a panel of veterinarians were selected after being recommended as experts in the industry. Three rounds of the same survey were used to gather consensus opinion from each expert panel about perceived disease risks and mitigation strategies. Both groups were given the same survey, with two additional questions about domestic and international terrorists asked of veterinarians. Results showed veterinarians and managers have very similar views on the likelihood of disease caused by terrorism, natural introduction, or accidental introduction, and on the importance of on-site security. Both groups agreed that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) or toxins would be the most likely agents to be introduced by a terrorist. Respondent groups disagreed on the importance of preventative products, disease transmission control and environmental control. Most differences can be attributed to veterinarians placing less importance on the aforementioned categories when considering likely routes of introduction for diseases considered in the survey. Difference in awareness of these issues is significant because veterinarians are pivotal in educating feedyard staff members about prevention of disease entry and transmission.</dc:description>
