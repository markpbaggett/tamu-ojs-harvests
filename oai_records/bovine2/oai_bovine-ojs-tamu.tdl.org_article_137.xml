	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this study was to determine performance, health, vaginal temperature, and behavior differences in calves vaccinated upon feedlot arrival with a multivalent modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine which included bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 2 antigen and calves vaccinated with a vaccine which did not include BVOV type 2. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Eightythree beef heifer calves were randomly assigned to receive a multivalent MLV vaccine containing either bovine herpesvirus-1, BVDV type 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza type-3 virus (n = 42; 4-WAY), or a MLVvaccine of similar formulation which also contained a BVDV type 2 antigen (n = 41; 5-WAY). Performance outcomes were evaluated at 30 and 60 days. Vaginal temperatures were evaluated hourly and daily. Cattle behavior activity was monitored with a real-time location system. Calves in the 5-WAY group had greater average daily gain (P = 0.026) at 60 days, excluding dead animals, compared to 4-WAY group. Treatment group was not associated with vaginal temperature. Calves in 5-WAY spent a greater (P ~ 0.01) amount of time at the feed bunk on days 0, 2, 3, and 4 compared to 4-WAY. Results of this study indicate no adverse effects from administering an additional strain of BVOV type 2 to high-risk heifers. Behavioral responses indicate a potential advantage to administer 5-WAY vaccine compared to 4-WAY vaccine.</dc:description>
