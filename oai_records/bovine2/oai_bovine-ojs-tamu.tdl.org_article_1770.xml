	<dc:description xml:lang="en">A seven-year-old pluriparturient Holstein cow was presented because of failure to complete parturition. On physical examination a 270-degree, counterclockwise uterine torsion was found. Attempts to correct the torsion via the vagina were unsuccessful as the fetus would immediately return to the dorso-ileal position when released. A left flank laparotomy was performed and the 270- degree counterclockwise torsion was confirmed. One hind limb has perforated the uterine wall and was the cause of failed attempts to correct the torsion vaginally. The live term, male fetus was delivered by cesarean section. The uterus and body wall were routinely closed and the cow was treated for shock. She died 12 hours post-operatively.</dc:description>
