	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Three male beef calves, 3-4 mo of age, died a few days after vaccination and castration. Because the pasture had been used several years without incident by the producer for calving, environmental causes were low on the differential diagnosis list. Because there was not an opportunity to examine the calves ante-mortem and necropsy findings were unremarkable, the practitioner relied on the producer?s description of clinical signs, then worked with the producer and pathologist to reach a definitive diagnosis of lead poisoning. The blood lead level in one calf that died was 4.3 ppm, and the kidney lead level was 101 ppm. Economic concerns were compounded due to potential exposure of a number of cows in the first trimester of pregnancy.</dc:description>
