	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The following case history became a nightmare to both veterinarian and owner before it was resolved.
A Holstein dairy farm containing 120 head was begun in Sept. 1976. The facilities were built from scratch upon recommendations from extension people and much personal investigation by the owner operators. The facilities were all under one roof for convenience and economy of construction. The feeding trough ran through the middle of the large housing barn which was divided by the feeding trough so the cattle could be split into 2 groups and fed according to production. The feeding system was a belt model designed so that silage and grain could be fed on one or both sides. The grain concentrate mixture was mixed by a weighing catch hopper before falling onto the belt. By the time the grain-silage mixture hit the bunk it was thoroughly mixed, so very little or no separation could occur in the trough by the cows. The amount of silage and grain being fed was determined by collecting the amount of each conveyed out during a specific time length and weighing it.</dc:description>
