	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is an important disease of fed cattle and knowledge gaps exist regarding factors predict­ing treatment success. The study objective was to identify po­tential relationships between risk factors known at the time of initial BRD treatment with 3 post-treatment outcomes: first treatment success (FTS), non-cause specific case fatal­ity risk (CFRALL), and cause-specific case fatality risk (CFRBRD). This retrospective analysis used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate relationships between covariates of interest with each outcome. Analysis included 132,521 individual-animal initial BRD treatment re­cords from 14 central U.S. feedyards (May 2017 to Dec 2020) with overall FTS of 67.8%, CFRALL of 10.0%, and CFRBRD of 6.3%. The FTS was associated (P &amp;lt; 0.05) with all covariates ex­cept sex, CFRALL was associated with all covariates, and CFR­BRD was associated with all covariates except day-of-week treated. Treatments early in the feeding phase (DOF 0-10, 11- 20) resulted in lower (P &amp;lt; 0.05) FTS (49.2% ± 0.8; 55.3% ± 0.8), higher (P &amp;lt; 0.05) CFRALL (12.5% ± 1.3; 12.6% ± 1.4) and higher (P &amp;lt; 0.05) CFRBRD (6.3% ± 1.1; 6.1% ± 1.0) compared to cattle treated on days 21-70. Rectal temperature in the 103.1-104.0 (39.4-40.0 °C) category had higher (P &amp;lt; 0.05) CFRALL (15.3% ± 1.5) and CFRBRD (9.2% ± 1.5) compared to other rectal tempera­ture categories. Specific risk factors including days on feed at treatment, sex and weight at the time of treatment were associ­ated with treatment outcomes. Results can be useful for defin­ing expectations following first treatment for BRD.</dc:description>
