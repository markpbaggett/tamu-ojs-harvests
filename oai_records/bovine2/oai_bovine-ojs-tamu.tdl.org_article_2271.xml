	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Vegetative endocarditis due to bacterial colonization of the endocardium has been known to occur in cattle for many years. Currently it is thought that abscesses or chronic infection plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The earliest clinical signs are usually non-specific and closely resemble those of other disease entities such as traumatic reticuloperitonitis and pneumonia. Affected cattle typically present with a history of recurrent fever, anorexia, weight loss, and depression of a few weeks to several months duration. Intermittent or shifting leg lameness without external trauma is sometimes associated with endocarditis. Tachycardia, systolic murmurs and loud pounding heart sounds are common findings upon physical exam. If untreated the clinical signs usually increase in intensity and signs of congestive heart failure often become evident. The CBC changes usually seen with endocarditis are those due to chronic inflammation. In the cases discussed here, hyperfibrinogenemia and a decreased plasma protein:fibrinogen ratio were the most common findings. Serum chemistry abnormalities are dependent upon the organ systems secondarily affected. Blood culture is a practical and useful tool to aid in the diagnosis of endocarditis. However, it is important to interpret the results of blood culture in keeping with the other clinical findings. The most commonly recovered organisms are Corynebacterium pyogenes and Streptococcus spp..</dc:description>
