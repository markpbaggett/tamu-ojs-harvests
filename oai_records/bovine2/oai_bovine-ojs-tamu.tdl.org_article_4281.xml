	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Acclimation and low-stress cattle handling techniques (ALSCH) are promoted to improve cattle welfare. The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the impact of ALSCH in relation to conventional handling (CON) on bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and performance of cattle during the feedlot phase of production. Abruptly weaned calves (n=136; 6 to 9 months of age) were transported to a research feedyard, and randomly enrolled into 4 pens-2 replicates of CON and 2 replicates of ALSCH. Conventionally handled calves were processed through a tub and curved alleyway facility without being acclimated. ALSCH calves were systematically acclimated to the feedyard environment and an open-sided "Bud-box" design working facility prior to processing. There were no differences in respiratory morbidity between treatment groups (P=0.34). From day 19 to day 95, ADG of CON calves was 2.70 lb (1.23 kg)/day versus 2.92 lb (1.33 kg)/day for ALSCH (P=0.01). Calves in CON pens tended to have a lighter mean hot carcass weight that was approximately 29 lb (13.2 kg) lighter than calves in the ALSCH pens (P=0.07). This clinical trial provides preliminary evidence that ALSCH may result in short-term performance benefits when applied to abruptly weaned calves in a feedyard setting, and provides background information for further scientific investigation.</dc:description>
