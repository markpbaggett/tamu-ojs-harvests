	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Growth Promoting Implants have and will continue to be one of the most economically beneficial practices in the field of beef production. Of current products on the market the recently introduced combination of trenbolone acetate and estradiol (Revalor-S) appears to give the best results in ADG and F/G compared to other products when used as single implants. Most products are used in reimplantation regimens in which many combinations have been successfully tested, however, much variability has been seen with several of these regimens. Due to many variables affecting efficacy of the implants and the different modes of action of different implants the most beneficial use of the existing products requires an assessment of the goals of the beef producer and selection of regimens to best satisfy these goals. Implantation of heifers intended for breeding can be legally done with Synovex-C after 45 days of age. The advisability of this practice is in question due to potential impact of subsequent reproduction but appears to be safe. More work is needed. Implantation with growth promoting hormones will continue to be a key part of beef production and will continue to be improved through new methods and new products.</dc:description>
