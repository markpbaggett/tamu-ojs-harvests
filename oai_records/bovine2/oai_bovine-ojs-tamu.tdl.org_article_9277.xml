	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The study objective was to describe the consumption of chlor­tetracycline (CTC)-medicated mineral offered free-choice to beef cows on pasture in Mississippi. Gestating commercial beef cows (n = 103) housed on pasture were divided into 3 pasture groups. Each pasture group had access to portable, self-contained feeding units that recorded cow identifica­tion by radio frequency identification tags, feeding time and mass consumed per feeding event. After feeding a 50:50 dried distillers grain (DDG)/NaCl mixture in the units for a 27-day adaptation period, the DDG/NaCl mixture was replaced by a commercial granular mineral containing CTC (6,172 mg CTC/ kg mineral). Medicated-mineral intake was monitored for 46 days from 7/5/2022 to 8/19/2022. Associations between the in­dependent variables (i.e., cow age, pasture group, etc.) and the dependent variables (i.e., total kilograms of CTC-medicated mineral supplement consumed during the trial period, total days the feeding unit was visited per cow during the trial peri­od, etc.) were tested using linear regression models. Statistical significance was set a priori at alpha = 0.05. On average, 27% of cows consumed mineral each day. During the 46-day trial period, the average dose of CTC received per cow was 0.53 mg CTC/kg body weight/day, and 92/103 cows consumed less than the label-indicated 1.1 mg/kg/day dose during the trial period. As cow age increased, feeder visits became less frequent (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and total consumption of CTC-medicated mineral declined (P &amp;lt; 0.001). In this study, feeding CTC-medicated min­eral in a free-choice manner did not ensure cows on pastu</dc:description>
