	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Fortunately, FMD has not been diagnosed in the United States since 1929 even though it has been diagnosed in Canada in 1952 and in Mexico, 1946-1954. We have had nine outbreaks of FMD and the largest was in 1914 and 1915. It started in Michigan, soon became established in the Chicago Union Stockyards, and spread to 22 States and the District of Columbia. It involved the depopulation of 77,000 cattle, 85,000 swine, 10,000 sheep, 100 goats, and 9 deer.
With these examples, it is evident that the threat of exotic diseases gaining entry is very real. Since the cost/benefit ration for keeping exotic disease out of the United States is 1/120, it is imperative that we be aware worldwide of the existence as well as the known endemic areas for each foreign animal disease of interest.</dc:description>
