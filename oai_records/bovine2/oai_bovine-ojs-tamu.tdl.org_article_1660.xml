	<dc:description xml:lang="en">This study compared the pregnancy rate in cows inseminated after two different pre-synchronization protocols based on clinical features of the genital tract and treatment with either PGF2α or GnRH. A total of 340 reproductively normal lactating dairy cows was divided in two groups. Cows in Group 1 (n=216) had a corpus luteum when palpated per rectum on day 0. These cows were administered 25 mg of PGF2α on day 0, 100υg ofGnRH on day 14, 25 mg of PGF2α on day 21, 100 υg of GnRH on day 23, and time-inseminated 16-h later. Cows detected in estrus from day Oto day 14 were inseminated 10 to 12-h after signs of estrus.
Cows in Group 2 (n=124) either had a large ovarian follicle and uterine tone, or a corpus hemorragicum whenpalpated per rectum on day 0. These cows received 100 υg of GnRH on day 0, 100 υg of GnRH on day 8, 25 mg of PGF2α on day 15, 100 υg of GnRH on day 17, and time-inseminated 16-h later. Cows detected in estrus before the end of the treatment protocol were inseminated 10 to 12-h after signs of estrus and removed from the study. Data collected were pregnancy rate for cows time-inseminated in Group 1, cows inseminated at detected estrus in Group 1, and cows time-inseminated in Group 2. Pregnancy rates were compared using logistic regression adjusted for number of previous services, parity, season and days in milk. There was no difference (p=0.83) in pregnancy rate between cows time-inseminated in Group 1 (35.9%) and Group 2 (32.8%). In Group 1, there was no difference (p=0.21) in pregnancy rate between cows time-inseminated (35.9%) and cows inseminated at detected estrus within 14-d after treatment with PGF2α (43.5%). Results of this study suggest that cows in different stages of the estrous cycle, as determined by rectal palpation of the genital tract, had similar pregnancy rates when they were selectively pre-synchronized with either PGF2α or GnRH.</dc:description>
