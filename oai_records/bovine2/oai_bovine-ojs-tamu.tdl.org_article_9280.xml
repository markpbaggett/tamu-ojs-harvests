	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Our objective was to compare bovine respiratory disease (BRD) first treatment protocols following metaphylaxis with tulathromycin in a two-phase study. The primary objective of Phase 1 was to compare effects of tulathromycin + ketoprofen versus florfenicol + flunixin meglumine (FLO+F) on primary health outcomes (retreatment and mortality) in ultra-high-risk feedlot cattle that received on-arrival metaphylaxis with tulathromycin. The Phase 2 objective was similar, but tildip­irosin was added as a third treatment group. In Phase 1, steers and heifers (n = 521; 402 ± 57 lb [182 ± 26 kg]) were enrolled at a Texas feedlot, and in Phase 2, steers (n = 788; 640 ± 105 lb [290 ± 48 kg]) were enrolled at a Canadian feedlot. At first BRD diag­nosis from natural exposure, cases were individually random­ized to experimental treatments. Linear and generalized linear models were used for statistical analyses. Case (BRD) fatality for cattle enrolled in Phases 1 and 2 were 2.36% (12/508) and 11.04% (87/788), respectively. In Phase 1, there was no evidence of differences in health outcomes (all P values ≥ 0.60). In Phase 2, retreatment risk did not significantly differ (P = 0.93), but to­tal and BRD-specific mortality were reduced and survival from enrollment to mortality was longer (P values &amp;lt; 0.05) for FLO+F compared to the other two treatments. Following tulathromy­cin metaphylaxis, antimicrobials used for first BRD treatment had similar effectiveness when subsequent health outcomes were infrequent (Phase 1), but FLO+F reduced mortalities when case fatality was higher (Phase 2).</dc:description>
