	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Infection of the uterus or the metritis complex is a commonly diagnosed disorder of the postpartum period in dairy cows. Rates of 32-80% have been reported in dairy herds. The effect of metritis on milk production is not well documented, however, in one study cows classified as having severe metritis had a significant decline in production compared to cows identified as normal or having a mild infection. Most investigations have been directed towards the effect metritis has on reproductive efficiency. When metritis was classified as mild or severe, the mild cases had no detrimental effect while those classed as severe had reduced fertility. In reports where there was no attempt to grade the infections, cows with metritis had lower reproductive efficiency.
In some cases the accuracy of making a diagnosis of metritis can be questioned, likewise, the need to treat all cases can be disputed, and the treatment strategy to follow is not clear. Over time thee has been a wide array of treatments used with generally a high degree of clinical recovery. There is no doubt that a high percentage of early postpartum metritis cases make a spontaneous recovery, and this must be considered when evaluating treatments. Unfortunately, there are few controlled trials to judge treatment efficacy.
In the past few years a better understanding of the postpartum period has been gained. The postpartum period has been characterized and classified into 3 periods. The bacteriology and endocrinology have been investigated, and the pathogenesis of pyometra outlined. The role that prostaglandins may have on the postpartum uterus and the involutionary process has been studied, and the various treatment options for uterine infections have been detailed.
The purpose of this study was to make a retrospective analysis from reproductive health records of postpartum metritis in a dairy herd.</dc:description>
