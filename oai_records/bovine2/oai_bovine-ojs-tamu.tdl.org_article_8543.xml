	<dc:description xml:lang="en">The objective of this study was to describe U.S. cow-calf producer access to and use of technology for managing cattle health and production records (CHPR). We anonymously surveyed 14,294 U.S. cow-calf producers. Multivariable logistic regression by manual forward variable selection was used to test demographic factors for association with CHPR-keeping technology outcomes. Smartphones, computers, and internet were available to 85.2%, 92.9%, and 88.7% of respondents, respectively. Factors associated with interest in a smartphone-based CHPR-keeping system included: smartphone use (OR = 7.7; compared to not using a smartphone), respondent age (≤ 54 years: OR = 4.8; 55-64 years: OR = 2.6; 65-74 years: OR = 1.5; compared to ≥75 years), electronic survey response (OR = 2.2; compared to paper), respondent keeps any form of CHPR (OR = 2.0; compared to no CHPR use), respondent education level (some college up to completed Bachelor’s degree: OR = 1.4; post-graduate or professional degree: OR = 1.5; compared to high-school diploma or less), cow-calf operation is not primary income source (OR = 1.3; compared to cow-calf operation being primary income source), region of the U.S. (midwest: OR = 1.1; mountain: OR = 0.8; northeast: OR = 1.4; northern plains: OR = 0.9; southeast: OR = 1.4; southern plains: OR = 1.0; compared to west) and respondent herd size (50-199 head: OR = 1.2; ≥ 200 head: OR = 1.4; compared to ≤ 49 head). Technology needed for electronic CHPR-keeping is common among U.S. cow-calf producers, however, individual demographic characteristics modified interest in electronic CHPR-keeping.</dc:description>
