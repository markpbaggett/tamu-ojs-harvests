	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Education of the client is an essential part of a herd health program. As a client becomes more knowledgeable he does a better job of health management and at the same time he becomes more understanding of the problems of the veterinarian and is a more co-operative person to deal with. In our practive we have had periodic educational meetings with our herd health clients since 1962. We have covered all aspects of dairy cattle health including nutrition during that time. At present we are updating our clientsâ€™ information with repeat lectures on neonatal disease, reproductive problems, etc. We also co-operate with the breed associations, breeding units, Ministry of Agriculture, and milk producer groups, by participating in continuing education programs which they offer their members. Practioners engaged in herd health work must also keep updated.</dc:description>
