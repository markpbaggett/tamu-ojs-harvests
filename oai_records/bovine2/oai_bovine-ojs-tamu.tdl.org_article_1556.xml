	<dc:description xml:lang="en">Three major outbreaks of Neospora abortion in 3 dairy herds in The Netherlands during 1992-1993 are reported. All outbreaks lasted 3 weeks, during the summer or early autumn, and were followed by the birth of mummified fetuses during the next 3 months. Unexpected heat in herdmates, previously diagnosed as pregnant, was also seen. There were 85 abortions in total. The length of gestation for 50 Neospora fetuses was 180Ã±36 days. Within 1 year after the outbreak, 50% of the animals were culled. 49 cows were rebred. Fertility immediately after abortion was not impaired. 75 pregnancies were followed, including 21 during the second and 8 during the third year after the outbreak. 70 apparently healthy calves, including 5 sets of twins, were born. Three calves were stillborn. Three cows aborted a Neospora-infected fetus for the second time. Serial blood samples from 43 cows tested by an ELISA indicated a decrease in antibodies to Neospora to low or undetectable levels within 2 months after abortion. A rise of antibodies during the second half of gestation (following the initial outbreak) was recorded in 58% of the animals. Precolostral serum antibodies to Neospora, indicating intrauterine infection, were present in 68% of the calves tested. Seronegative cows produced seronegative calves. In all herds, seroprevalence increased after the outbreak.</dc:description>
